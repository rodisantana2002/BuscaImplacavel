3,arquivo,ABS,"Abstract. Background – Startup companies are becoming important suppliers  of innovative and software intensive products. The failure rate among startups  is high due to lack of resources, immaturity, multiple influences and dynamic  technologies. However, software product engineering is the core activity in  startups, therefore inadequacies in applied engineering practices might be a  significant contributing factor for high failure rates. Aim – This study identifies  and categorizes software engineering knowledge areas utilized in startups to  map out the state-of-art, identifying gaps for further research. Method – We  perform a systematic literature mapping study, applying snowball sampling to  identify relevant primary studies. Results – We have identified 54 practices  from 14 studies. Although 11 of 15 main knowledge areas from SWEBOK are  covered, a large part of categories is not. Conclusions – Existing research does  not provide reliable support for software engineering in any phase of a startup  life cycle. Transfer of results to other startups is difficult due to low rigor in  current studies.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:32:28

6,arquivo,###,"Recent developments in technologies have created an increasing demand for  innovative software products. Startup companies are addressing this need and gain  importance as suppliers of software-intensive products and innovation. The inherent  nature of software enables small companies to produce and launch software products  fast with few resources. However, most of startup companies fail before realizing any  significant achievements [11]. Partially this is due to market factors or financial  issues, however the impact of software product engineering and inadequacies in  applied engineering practices is not fully explored, and might be a significant  contributing factor for the high failure rates.   Chorev et al. [8] identify 16 key factors for a successful startup, such as political  and economical environment, marketing,  idea, funding and product development  among others. Many authors [2, 3, 8, 12, 26, 41] address general issues of startups.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:32:46

9,arquivo,###,"Only a few focus on how software engineering is done in startups. Yau et al. argue  that scaled down engineering practices solve problems present in larger, established  companies while ignoring specific challenges that emerge only in startup companies,  stating that different approaches altogether are needed for software engineering in the  context of startups [20].  In this paper we aim at identifying software-intensive product engineering  practices utilized in startup companies and mapping them to Software Engineering  Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) [31] knowledge areas and categories, describing  both state-of-the art, and gaps in research on startup software engineering.  Furthermore, to analyze how identified software engineering knowledge areas support  the startup life cycle we use the four phase model proposed by Crowne [11] and map  identified knowledge areas to different phases in the startup life-cycle. By use of these  well-established taxonomies [2], [10] we show state-of-the-art and expose gaps for  further research, but with a clear and distinct focus on the software engineering  perspective.   This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the field and  motivates the study. Section 3 details the research methodology we applied to identify  and map relevant papers. Section 4 reports results from the mapping. Section 5  answers the research questions and discusses the results. Section 6 concludes the  paper.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:33:04

11,arquivo,###,"A startup company shares many features with small or medium enterprises such as  youth, market pressure and dynamic technologies [33]. However startups are different  due to their aim and the challenges they face [33]. In contrast to established  companies, who regardless of their size focus on optimizing an existing business  model, startups focus of finding one [26]. Sutton [33] defines a startup as an  organization that is challenged by youth and immaturity, extremely limited resources,  multiple influences and dynamic technologies and markets.  Crowne [11] had proposed a four phase start-up life-cycle model. Successfully  transferring from first phase to the last indicates that a startup has become an  established company. The model identifies distinct challenges at each phase that a  start-up must address to advance to the next stage. We seek to identify knowledge  areas supporting transfer trough start-up life cycle by addressing challenges identified  by Crowne [11].     Paternoster et al. [23] conducted a mapping study to characterize state-of the-art  research in startups. They conclude that only a minority of studies in the area are  dedicated to (software) engineering, and since 2000 when this gap was first identified  [33] it has been only partially filled.  Coleman et al. [9] conducted a grounded theory study to explore how software  processes are formed in a startup. This study concludes that there is not enough resources  to explore the best way to develop the software and startups use whatever software  process that supports their immediate business objective. Consequently, the development",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:33:16

13,arquivo,###,"process is heavily influenced by previous experiences of a person acting as development  manager [9].  Pino et al. [25] conducted a systematic review on software process improvement  (SPI) in small and medium organizations. The study is aimed at discovering what  approaches to SPI in small-medium companies exist. Although their study was not  aimed at startup organizations, they conclude that prescriptive approaches, such as  CMM and SPICE, are not suitable for small organizations. Therefore, they emphasize  the need for more lightweight and tailored approaches.  Several startup specific process models have addressed this need. For example,  LIPE [40] addresses immaturity, ad-hoc approaches and scalability of engineering  processes. ESSDM [4] proposes an iterative approach to build and validate multiple  product ideas simultaneously. The Helical model [13] supports innovation by  experimentation of multiple product ideas, frequent releases and synchronization with  other organizational processes.  Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) characterizes content of  software engineering discipline and promotes consistent view to software  engineering. SWEBOK is organized in 15 main knowledge areas; each knowledge  area is organized in sub-categories. Although, SWEBOK is not specifically aimed at  startups it is widely recognized within software engineering community [31].   To understand the degree to which research supports software engineering in  startups, it is useful to map existing studies. One recent contribution is the mapping  study by Paternoster et al. [23], describing research on startups and providing a  characterization of software development in the startup context. However, their work  does not classify the identified work practices such that it can be understood what  software engineering problem is actually addressed. In contrast, our study aims at  identifying and classifying software engineering knowledge areas in startup  companies, enabling a) analysis and improvement of existing practices and b)  revealing opportunities for further investigation.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:33:28

16,arquivo,###,3.1 Research Questions  Our study is driven by the goal to understand to what extent engineering in startup  companies is supported by research. To pursue this goal we seek answers to the  following research questions:   RQ1: What is state-of-practice in terms of utilization of software engineering  knowledge areas in startups?,,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:33:46

18,arquivo,###,"RQ2: What is the relevance and rigor of the studies reporting experiences from  software engineering in startups?  In order to structure the identified practices into knowledge areas, as well as  identify gaps in knowledge (RQ1) we use SWEBOK [31] as a software engineering  dictionary. Although SWEBOK was not created for startups, we lack alternatives, and  SWEBOK is considered the accepted SE subject area overview [6, 28]. To provide an  account whether the practices can be transferred to industry (RQ2) we assess rigor  and relevance [17] of the identified studies.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:33:58
19,arquivo,###,"3.2 Mapping Study Design Overview  Identification of Primary Studies: We used snowball sampling [38], defining the  starting set from an earlier and broader mapping study on startups [23]. We performed  only forward snowball sampling from the starting set, as earlier papers are likely to be  covered by the previous study by Paternoster et al. [23].  We screened the sampled papers to select studies that report on primary research  focused on software engineering practices in startups. At first, for each paper we  applied a sanity check filtering out duplicates, non-English and non-peer-reviewed  papers. We used titles and abstracts for screening; in ambiguous cases, we read the  full text. The screening criteria are summarized in table 1.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:34:04

In the  mapping, we keep track on coverage – how many of knowledge areas and categories  are covered by evidence. Coverage, or lack of it, reveals gaps in current research. We  also use startup life cycle model by Crowne [11] to identify to what extent state-of- practice covers all four phases of startup life cycle.   To answer our second research question (RQ2: What is the relevance and rigor of  the studies reporting experiences from software engineering in startups?) we  synthesize rigor, relevance and research type, and analyze number of cases per study.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:34:28
24,arquivo,###,"3.4 Threats to Validity  Systematic reviews have a generic bias towards positive results as they get published  more often [5]. However, we do not consider this as a major threat as we especially  aim to identify gaps and do not address the performance of individual practices.  Another generic threat to mapping studies using snowball sampling is related to the  quality of the starting set [38]. As a starting set we have selected the 43 studies  identified by Paternoster et al. [23]. The set covers a rather broad period from 1994 to  2013, includes both journal and conference papers from multiple publishing venues.  Thus, the starting set follows all guidelines set forth by Wohlin [38].  We focused on forward snowball sampling, as earlier studies are likely to be  covered by the previous mapping study by Paternoster et al. [23]. Nevertheless, we  performed a backward iteration on the final set of papers to reduce the risk of missing  important studies. As a result, 241 papers were discovered. Subsequent screening  identified one [20] relevant study. Furthermore, we have conducted a review of gray  literature to screen further information pertaining to our research questions. This  resulted in one more paper [12], which we did however not include in the further  analysis because the described practices are already reported in other, peer-reviewed,  studies.  Threats to study selection are addressed by explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria,  and a detailed screening protocol. Explicit extraction templates guided the data  extraction process, thus ensuring uniformity of the extracted data. To avoid bias set by  personal opinions of the researchers executing the study, ambiguous cases were  discussed among the authors.",,02/05/2019 11:33:04,02/05/2019 14:34:34
