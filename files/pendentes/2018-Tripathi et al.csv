In the context of software startups, due to  their small sizes and their staffs’ limited software development ex perience, RE processes are basic ( Paternoster et al., 2014; Klotins  et al., 2015 ).

Introduction  Software startups are important for the economy due to their  potential for creating jobs and adding value to domestic products  on a global scale ( Kane, 2010 ). However, due to their characteris tics, including limited resources and staff with limited product de velopment experience, product development occurs with irregular  software engineering practices, and such practices often depend on  startups’ contexts ( Tripathi et al., 2016 ). In software engineering,  using unreliable RE techniques can cause software projects to fail.

Moreover, due to importance of software startups in eco nomic growth and the roles of product developments in the soft ware startups’ success, it is important to quantify extant knowl edge on RE in software startups and gather empirical data from  real software startup cases. This study aimed to address these  needs and achieve the following ﬁve objectives:  • Exploring sources used by software startups to gather require ments;  • Examining techniques used by software startups to elicit re quirements from sources;  • Studying documentation methods used by software startups to  store requirements;  • Exploring techniques used by software startups to prioritize re • Examining methods applied by software startups to validate re quirements; and  quirements.  To reach the objectives and address the research gaps, sev eral research questions were formulated ( Table 1 ). The decision  was made to conduct a comprehensive study using an MLR (i.e.,  to examine all literature that highlights RE in software startups)  (i.e., to collect empirical data about RE in software startups)  ( Garousi et al., 2016 ) and perform a case survey on the topic  ( Larsson, 1993 ).

16,2018-Tripathi et al,###,"2.2. Requirements engineering  RE is an important phase in successful software develop ment. If requirements are not collected properly, projects can fail  ( Pacheco and Garcia, 2012; Verner et al., 2007 ). RE contains several  phases, such as elicitation, analysis, speciﬁcation, and validation  ( Bourque and Fairley, 2014 ). Requirement elicitation is a signiﬁcant  aspect of RE, in which requirements are elicited from many differ ent sources; hence, it is vital to recognize and assess all potentially  useful sources ( Pacheco and Garcia, 2012; Bourque and Fairley,  2014 ). Some of the techniques involved are interviews (can pro vide suﬃcient data from the participants in a speciﬁc time), ques tionnaires (can collect data from multiple stakeholders simulta neously), brainstorming (informal discussion with different stake holders to gather several ideas), domain analysis (analysis of ex isting documents to gather domain related knowledge), and obser vation (collecting the data by observing the process without any  direct inﬂuence) ( Zowghi and Coulin, 2005 ).  In requirement speciﬁcation, documents are created through  which the requirements are thoroughly assessed in terms of under standability, correctness, completeness, and consistency ( Bourque  and Fairley, 2014; Condori-Fernandez et al., 2009 ). Then, once the  documentation is created, it is important to analyze and prioritize  the requirements in terms of values to stakeholders. The objective  is to create features that are the most valuable to stakeholders ﬁrst  and then consider other aspects, such implementation costs and  resource availabilities ( Bourque and Fairley, 2014; Achimugu et al.,  2014 ). Some prioritization techniques used in software engineering  are numerical assignment (requirements are characterized in terms  of high, medium, and low), the pairwise comparison technique (re quirements are grouped in pairs and analyzed to obtained ﬁnal rat ings of the requirements), and the cost-value prioritization tech nique (requirements are mapped against development costs using  graphs) ( Achimugu et al., 2014 ). Once requirements are collected  and analyzed through documentation, it is important to validate  them to ensure that they align with company strategies and that  stakeholders (especially developers) understand the requirements  in terms of clarity and consistency. Some techniques for validation  are prototyping (used to determine whether the developer under stood the requirements), model validation (use of models like ob tion and ﬂow of information between objects) and acceptance tests  ject models or formal analysis notations to establish communica (helps in validating the use of systems by end users) ( Bourque and  Fairley, 2014 ).  In the context of small software companies, Aranda  ment gathering practices differently, and the companies’ cultures  et al. (2007) observed that small companies perform require affect requirement gathering. The researchers also found that  requirement practices are inﬂuenced by customer types, team  experience, founders’ choices, and company sizes. Moreover,  companies, there are often two major problems during require Quispe et al. (2010) observed that, with very small software  ment gathering. First, there are communication and collaboration  differences and gaps between customers and teams. Second,  unstandardized RE practices are used.  In software startups, due to strict time constraints and lim ited resources, requirements are mostly self-invented, rarely doc umented, and validated only after product releases. Moreover, re quirements are often market driven, as customers and users are  not frequently recognized during the initial stages of product de velopment ( Paternoster et al., 2014 ). Thus, there may be a lack of  external stakeholder presence in startups’ RE processes ( Mater and  Subramanian, 20 0 0 ). Including customers and users as stakehold ers in elicitation processes and the use of adaptable techniques,  such as user stories and estimations, can help software startups in",,09/05/2019 23:21:50,

Concerning RE in soft ware startups, two studies ( Melegati et al., 2016; Gralha et al.,  2018 ) have taken a grounded theory approach to understand the  process. Melegati et al. (2016) proposed a theoretical model based  on nine interviews with different Brazilian software startups to  give an overview of the RE process and how elements in star tups affect the process. Similarly, Gralha et al. (2018) collected data  from 16 software startups to describe the evolution of require ments practices through six dimensions and the effects they can  have on the products, staff, and company.  Bajwa et al. (2017) systematically explored gray literature to as Concerning reviews of gray literature in software startups,  sess pivots in software startups. Moreover, in relation to RE, some  discussed software requirement prioritization and RE in software  product lines (e.g., Achimugu et al., 2014; Alves et al., 2010 ).  Babar et al. (2014) conducted a systematic literature review to ex plore past systematic literature studies on RE.  In addition to the studies above, two were similar to this study  (see Holl et al., 2012; Rabiser et al., 2010 ). They combined system atic literature reviews and surveys to analyze abilities to support  multi-product lines and requirements for product derivation sup port. However, comprehensive studies on RE in software startups  that combine systematic literature reviews and empirical tech niques are not present in the extant literature. To address this re search gap, this study uses an MLR ( Garousi et al., 2016 ) and a case  survey ( Larsson, 1993 ) on RE in software startups to answer the  research questions and reach the study objectives (see Section 1 ).  The next section discusses the research process in detail.  3. Research methodology  To address the research objectives and fulﬁll the research gap,  research questions were formulated ( Table 1 ).

Qualitative data analysis  To analyze the qualitative data, data extractions and syntheses  were done using NVivo 11, and an integrated approach (deductive  and inductive methods) was taken ( Cruzes and Dyba, 2011 ). The  approach allowed codes to be organized in the rational forms of  ployed using a ground-up method from which concepts emerged.  start lists and precodes; moreover, allowed the codes to be em ated to ﬁnd important variables. The objective was incorporating  With a deductive approach, start lists and precodes were cre concepts that were already discussed in studies. Precodes were  primary articles (speciﬁcally, requirement sources, elicitation tech created to extract information about various categories from the  niques, requirement documents, requirement management, and  validation methods). For example, consider text from the primary  article [P18]: “The elicitation phase is clearly different depending  on whether it is a clientor user-targeted startup.

However, the latter is different: There is no such person  as the client to ask for requirements.” This quotation comes from  a discussion of requirement sources; hence, it was labeled in the  precode as “requirement sources.” Similarly, the precodes’ internal  sources; business goals; analyses of similar products; standards,  laws and regulations; market trends and potential and existing  customers were created under requirement sources to extract in formation collected on the features from the case survey.  viewed line by line so that any of the elements that appeared were  An inductive approach was also applied in which text was re assigned to the code. Furthermore, the codes were constantly com pared to reﬁne the existing codes and generate new ones. Specif ically, the inductive approach was used for elements like source  identiﬁcation, elicitation techniques, value deﬁnitions, and require ment management to constantly compare the extracted text from  cases and allow themes to emerge. For example, the data col lected for Q31 in Table 3 were analyzed line by line so that any  concepts or themes that existed in the data could be recognized  in terms of how the requirement sources were identiﬁed in the  startup cases. The results of this inductive approach are described  in Section 4.3.3 .  3.4.2. Quantitative data analysis  year, research classiﬁcation, contribution, and pertinence, and the  The primary articles’ properties, in terms of type, publication  and case locations, were statistically analyzed in relation to fre cases’ properties, such as respondents’ relationships with startups  quencies. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the fre quency of each variable and recognize any patterns. Various fea tures, such as requirement sources, elicitation techniques, require ment documents, requirement document levels, requirement selec tion criteria, and validation methods, were statistically analyzed  according to frequency ( Blaikie, 2003 ). In addition, to determine  whether there were any relationships between variables, such as  requirement sources and elicitation techniques, bivariate correla tion was used. If there were several responses (e.g., to questions  about software application products and requirement sources),  multiple-response cross-tabulations and frequencies were used to  analyze the variables ( Blaikie, 2003 ). The results from the analyses  of the qualitative and quantitative data are discussed in the next  section.  4.

Requirement sources and elicitation techniques  Software startups are faced with uncertainty about whether  their product(s) can ﬁt their target market and meet their cus tomers’ expectations. Large companies have a slight advantage in  this regard based on their prior experience with product develop ceed. Therefore, startups need to continuously experiment, inno ment and their intuition about which types of product can suc vate, and iterate to create the best product/market ﬁt [G21, G15].  Making continuous changes to a product can result in the loss of a  market segment, so software startups need to build a product that  (based on evidence) to address broad markets, as well as speciﬁc  reaches certain viability standards, ﬁtting the product requirements  customer segments [G31]. However, interpreting product require ments can be a challenging process for software startups because  they do not use traditional RE practices [P10, G11]. Instead, their RE  is inﬂuenced by business actions and external factors [G11, P18].  Requirement elicitation, an important aspect of RE, involves col lecting requirements from all potential sources using appropriate  elicitation methods ( Bourque and Fairley, 2014 ). Concerning soft ware startups, Melegati et al. [P18] interviewed startup members  and found that requirement elicitation techniques depend on the  type of target (i.e., customer or user) in focus. In a single case  study [P8], when the researchers observed the early stages of a  startup, the product team or founder used elicitation techniques,  and all the individuals in the startup contributed by providing the  requirements. However, as that startup grew in size, the project  manager reviewed and managed the elicitation process. Such a  process has various advantages; for example, it enables stakehold ers to collaborate and reveals product limitations [P26]. The use of  game planning to analyze features was reported by [P6]; in con trast, if the users are unknown, persona and scenario techniques  can help improve the elicitation processes [P10].  4.3.1.

Therefore, through an analysis of similar  products, some features of existing products can be adopted to re duce uncertainty and avoid the necessity of feature validation [P4].  Business goals, market trends, and standard laws and regulations.  Business goals (51%, 41 cases) and market trends (45%, 36 cases)  were the next most used sources in this study, whereas standard  laws and regulations (27%, 22 cases) appeared to be the least used  source. According to [P9], to produce a scalable B2B product, some  startups consider business as needed to create requirements and  solutions, and they do not focus on users’ problems. In C33 and  C46, a business plan and canvas were helpful requirement sources.  Some studies ([P18] and [P26]) pointed out that markets are im portant factors for software startups, and a good understanding of  a market can enable it to assess customer requirements and under stand competitor products [P25]. In case C71, market trends were  observed using online searches and observations. As for standard  laws and regulations, one possible reason for their lack of sources  used could be the strictness of these guidelines. For some cases,  such as C17 and C46, startups were able to select relevant laws and  regulations through their previous experiences with similar prod ucts. In addition, [P18] observed that startups focusing on ﬁnancial  and defense markets need to follow strict requirement processes,  as this is an important customer requirement. Hence, collecting  requirements from standard laws and regulations is compulsory if  the domain of a target product requires compliance with these reg ulations.  4.3.2. Source selection based on software application domain  During the analyses, it was interesting to see whether there  were any relationships between requirement sources and types  of software applications used in products. Table 7 shows a cross tabulation of multiple responses regarding the use of requirement  sources in a speciﬁc software application. As shown in the ta ble, the most used sources for various applications were as fol lows: for data-dominant software, internal sources (89%, 50 cases)  and potential and existing customers (75%, 42 cases); for system  software, internal sources (92%, 11 cases) and potential and ex isting customers (75%, 9 cases); and for control-dominant soft ing customers (69%, 13 cases). An interesting observation here is  ware, internal sources (92%, 11 cases) and potential and exist that products using data-dominant software, system software and  control-dominant software frequently used internal (invention or  brainstorming) and potential/existing customers as their sources.  products (88%, 14 cases) were frequently used sources, along with  However, for computation-dominant software, analyses of similar  internal sources (100%, 16 cases) and customers (100%, 16 cases).  The reason for the frequent selection of internal sources and cus tomers as a source can be explained by the small sizes of software  ments for a product is essential for the startup to establish itself  startups; if a startup has customers, considering customer require in the market.  4.3.3. Factors leading to source identiﬁcation and selection  In response to Question 32 (see Table 3 ), 80 respondent an swers were extracted. During the analysis, four broad themes (as  factors) emerged that resulted in source identiﬁcation and selec tion, which are discussed below.  In-house decisions. In-house decisions often led to the identi ﬁcation and selection of sources. In 20 cases, requirement source  identiﬁcation and selection occurred during an in-house decision making process. Decisions on source selection were made during  brainstorming meetings with teams, team formation planning and  the selection of organization practices (C2 and C23).

In the same table, the “Percentage” column rep “Percentage of Cases” column represents the percentage of cases  resents the percentage of responses for each source, whereas the  that used each source.  71 cases), for example, invention or brainstorming, was the ma Internal sources. It is apparent that an internal source (88.8%,  jor source of requirements in the software startups. As startups  are innovative in nature, they need to be creative when gather ing requirements. Various activities, such as invention or brain storming, seem to be a common approach for creative thinking  ( Maiden and Robertson, 2005 ). Early stage software startups have  no customers, and ﬁnding customers is challenging for these star tups [P26]; hence, the vision and requirements for a startup are  outlined by its founder(s) and technical employees, such as de velopers [P6]. Similar cases were mentioned in [P9] and [P26], in  which the founders, chief technical oﬃcer (CTO) and chief exec utive oﬃcer (CEO) provided minimum features through intuition  and experience. In the case survey, a respondent from case C71  mentioned that internal sources were selected based on previous  experience, whereas respondents from other cases, such as C3, C23,  sions to collect requirements. The experience of internal members  C58, and C72, stated that their teams conducted brainstorming ses is crucial for requirement sources when users and customers are  unknown [P28].  Potential and existing customers. The next most used source was  potential and existing customers (74%, 59 cases). For software star tups, a focus on customers is essential for business growth, so  customer perception should be a priority [G15, G30]. For exam ple, members of an internal startup in Microsoft, during their ini tial stage, created several product requirements, but later, when  they talked to their customers, the product requirements changed  completely [G30]. In the case survey, the teams in cases C2 and  C10 met and spoke with customers about the requirements. Dis cussing requirements with customers (and asking them the right  questions) can help make product features suitable for large mar ket sections and reduce wasted time and resources during the  initial feature-gathering stages [G31, G34]. Sometimes, customers  have original ideas and provide their requirements (C29, C36). In  addition, if a product contains features that hold perceived values  for customers, then a pleased customer can endorse the product to  others [P28].  Analyses of similar products. The next most used source observed  in this study was the analysis of similar products (70%, 56 cases).  Some startups aim to incorporate few features that are similar to  successful rival products. Analyses of similar products can provide  several possible solutions for problems that a startup product is  trying to address, thereby making new products better than the  existing ones [P25]. Another beneﬁt was mentioned in (C74); while  phones), they discovered a lack of similar products in Brazil, which  startup staff members were analyzing similar products (smart",,09/05/2019 23:21:50,

Similarly, in case  C38, analysis of a similar product was the chosen method for un derstanding other companies’ products in a similar ﬁeld and rec ognizing current trends.  Previous experience. Another theme identiﬁed from 19 cases was  the startup members’ previous experience with identifying and se lecting sources for requirements. The respondents from cases C8,  C16, C23, and C39 claimed that their previous experience in deal ing with a similar customer segment helped them select suitable  sources to extract the requirements for their products. Further more, in case C59, the founder tried to convert his undergraduate  thesis into a product, so his source selection was his thesis. Sim ilarly, cases C51 and C79 mentioned that previous job experience  in a company with a similar product helped them identify suitable  sources.  Background research. Apart from the above two themes, another  theme that emerged from 18 cases was conducting research on the  topic to familiarize oneself with the state of the art for a product  idea (C1). Research and Internet searches were conducted to ﬁnd  literature on the user, market, and competitor (C12, C22, C41, C47,  and C49). The aim was to develop an overview of reports related  to the product idea to better examine the user, customer, competi tion, and market. Their research allowed them to choose the right  sources for their requirements. In two cases (C29 and C30), it was  pointed out that conducting market research on the hottest trends  in the product domain enabled startup members to understand the  status of their product idea in the current market and ﬁnd suitable  requirement sources. Similarly, in C72 and C74, the respondents  conducted background research on similar products to ﬁnd exist ing solutions for the problem(s) they were currently working on,  and they considered the analysis of similar products as a source  for their requirements.  startup, whether from a mentor or personal acquaintance, pro Mentorship. Mentorship received during the early stages of a  vided direction in terms of choosing suitable sources for product  requirements (C6). In cases C12, C47, and C77, experts, acquain tances, and other entrepreneurs provided relevant guidance, while  in C1, C42, C66, and C75, sources were identiﬁed when startups  consulted with companies developing products in a similar domain  to obtain guidance.  4.3.4. Requirement elicitation techniques selected and applied  Once the sources are identiﬁed, it was important to elicit the  requirements from those sources using a suitable method. In the  context of software startups, Table 8 shows that analyses of sim sions (65%, 52 cases) are the most used elicitation methods.

Customer surveys (43%, 35 cases) and on-site customers  (30%, 24 cases) appear to be the least used methods of require ment gathering. We also analyzed how these elicitation methods  were applied, and the results are presented below.  alyzing similar products was used as an elicitation method in 55  Analyses of similar products/dedicated brainstorming sessions. An cases. In cases C12 and C80, this method was used to understand  their competitors’ products and the market, whereas for cases C23  and C65, it was used to ﬁnd information about rival product fea tures. In case C65, this technique was used to understand how cer tain features were developed. In terms of dedicated brainstorming  sessions, this method was selected to experiment with different  products and collect requirements from participants. In some cases,  sessions were organized to obtain a solution for various challenges  in relation to the product (C1 and C2), collect information con cerning the product design and feature selection (C21), and obtain  more information about the collected requirements so that better  requirements could be selected (C54). Brainstorming sessions can  be used when there is speculation regarding requirements to clar ify what is needed and generate enhanced requirements [G11]. In  C38 and C71, brainstorming sessions, which usually lasted an en tire day, were held several times before any ﬁnal decisions were  made (C38). Similarly, in [P23], brainstorming sessions were held  to identify the product goals and potential external stakeholders.  Customer interviews. Conducting customer interviews can help a  startup to quickly grasp the accuracy of the product requirements  (without wasting much time or resources on the guesswork) [G34].  Interviews are another good method for determining who the cus tomers are and measuring their’ perceived value [P17, G21]. Lis tening to customers during interview sessions can improve the va lidity of a problem and allow startups to gain knowledge regard ing the product domain [G11]. In cases C12, C37, C73, and C77,  customers were interviewed to obtain detailed requirements from  the customer point of view, receive conﬁrmation about whether  the product features actually align with the targeted product, and  identify any issues related to the requirements. In case (C67), cus tomer interviews were conducted while visiting and contacting  customers to collect their ideas. Customer interviews can be in isting products, and problems experienced by a founder [P4].  ﬂuenced by a founder’s knowledge and background, analysis of ex that startups should conduct surveys carefully to collect informa Customer surveys/feedback forms.

A respondent from  case C38 mentioned that feedback forms were used in conferences  or events to gather feedback from users face to face. The objective  was to obtain an overview of the product requirements.  Observations, prototypes, and mockups. Observation is a useful  tool for understanding what people do with a product, in contrast  to relying on what people say about the product features [G11].  Observations were conducted after receiving customer feedback in  C12 and to create constraints for a new product in C31. In other  cases, observations were conducted during conferences and events  with respect to how users were actually using the product or ser vice (C29), and observations were conducted on the use of rival  products to generate requirements (C80).

In cases  C2 and C5, prototypes were not only used to make sketches and  generate ideas but also as a tool for minimizing inaccuracies. Pro totypes are developed in house or with a small number of partic ipants (C29). In case C65, mockups were developed using Power Point presentations to discuss a product’s main features. Accord ing to the literature, such as [G24] and [G35], prototyping can help  in the following scenarios: negotiating multiple ideas regarding a  product, understanding user wishes, making a product technically  feasible, and understanding which requirements have a signiﬁcant  effect from the customer perspective [G35].  On-site customers. As the least used elicitation method, on-site  customers were observed in only 24 cases. This method is used  when a startup is in an early stage and does not yet have cus tomers. Thus, the CEO and management team can act as on-site  customers and provide the requirements [P6]. In case (C36), the re spondents mentioned the use of on-site customers as follows: “We  have very close on-site or remote contact without customers at the  moment and team is sitting in one oﬃce, so this is straightforward  for us.” In case C65, a business acted as an on-site customer. Ac cording to [P22], members from a marketing team can represent  the customer for the development team and help them to make  decisions about the requirements.  elicitation methods in a systematic way, whereas others used an  In our study, we noticed that some cases selected the above  ad hoc approach for selecting and using elicitation methods to cap ture their requirements. For example, in case C22, the approach  for requirement elicitation was systematic, involving observation,  custom interviews and surveys, analyses of similar products, brain storming, and prototyping. Similarly, for case C31, their approaches  were observation, analyses of similar products, brainstorming, and  prototyping. In addition, case C48 used elicitation methods in the  following sequence: customer feedback, brainstorming, analyses of  similar products, and ﬁnally, prototyping. Case C57 began by se lecting customer interviews and surveys and the analysis of simi lar products as elicitation methods, which they followed up with a  brainstorming session, on-site customers, and prototyping. In con trast, cases C3 and C78 used an ad hoc approach most frequently,  while cases C16 and C47 used a different combination of methods.  For case C80, the method selection strategy changed over time.  4.3.5.

This indicates that these methods have a   0.004, r   0.319), and observa statistically signiﬁcant linear relationship, but the magnitude of as sociation is weak (0.1 < r < 0.3). A reason for this result could be  that internal sources usually involve an internal team that works  during an ideation session to ﬁnd suitable requirements. Therefore,  using analyses of similar products as an elicitation method, as well  as using internal sources, will provide information on existing fea tures of similar products. Likewise, brainstorming sessions will en able the extraction of requirements from internal sources.  When analyses of similar products were chosen as requirement  sources, the statistically signiﬁcant, two-tailed values and Pear son correlation coeﬃcients for elicitation methods were as follows:  analyses of similar products ( p  tomers ( p   0.005, r   0.310).

However, startups with requirements involve follow ing strict guidelines need an accurate documentation process. The  authors in [P10] arrived at a similar conclusion; in this study,  the startup followed informal speciﬁcations and used ticket-based  tools, which contained user stories that described features in easy to-understand language. Physical tools, such as Post-it notes and  whiteboards, were also used to make product requirements visi ble to everyone. In [P8], the authors mentioned a startup that cre ated a document, called a list, to collect the relevant features and  time estimates given by the developer; the list was handled by  the project manager, who was also responsible for generating and  recording the features on the list.

In the startup case discussed in [P8], they created  a backlog for the features (handled by the project manager), and  the startup’s priorities were set based on the business value. How ever, in [P18], the startup created a layered prioritization scheme in  which the founders or senior managers determined the priorities  of a long-term plan. The authors in [P18] also pointed out that the  market has an effect on prioritization, and if a startup is customer  driven, then the customers set the priorities for product features.  4.5.1.

In other cases, the startups’ objectives were to build to features  that made product use easier for customers (C37) and increase  numbers of customers (C9, C10). Article [P17] pointed out that, to  improve customer value, understanding how one’s company per ceives customer value, interviewing important customers, and re ceiving feedback on product features are important. Moreover, it  was pointed out that investors are interested in startups that de velop products with customer value. The authors in [P9] and [P28]  noted that various practices, such as customer development and  lean startup methods, can add customer value. As stated in [P28],  “These practices emphasize that startups should concentrate on pro ducing customer value and avoid wasteful activities, i.e., non-value  adding activities”;  tive was to ensure that users were loyal to their products and not  User value: Some startups prioritized user value.

This was considered by startups so they  could be realistic about feature implementation (C32).  4.5.2. Changing requirements management  One observation was how startups managed changing require ments. Several aspects were considered during such management;  they are discussed below.  Increments. Incrementally working on projects was considered  beneﬁcial in terms of changing requirements management. For ex ample, C2 worked in increments and avoided planning details in  its initial stages. Doing so allowed it (and other startups) to use  adaptable processes (C15, C47). Especially, using Scrum, with its  practices like Sprint, helped many startups manage requirements  (C35, C42). For example, Sprint was used retrospectively by C70  to improve users’ feedback and manage product requirements. In  addition, C17 used iterations to develop products due to contract  requirements, according to which, customers could make changes  two developments ahead.  Use-case updates.

In fact, this method is useful for B2B  ﬁrms with limited numbers of customers. However, actual proto types (not just screenshots) need to be shown to customers so  that reliable customer feedback can be incorporated. In some star tups’ initial stages, prototypes’ limited functionalities were demon strated to customers (C38). As [G36] noted, mockup seven with  only a few features can allow customers to provide feedback.

Case C10 made the same observation: The  startup used prototypes to receive team feedback. Moreover, some  startups, such as C2 and C4, mentioned that they validated proto types internally, and this helped them determine risks and imple mentation costs. Others implemented internal reviews and proto types before conducting A/B tests (C32). Similarly, as noted by [P6],  development teams can give prototype demonstrations for man agement teams and work closely with such teams to gather instan taneous feedback.

In [G34] and [G3], it was men tioned that customer interviews are crucial because they provide  startups with necessary knowledge for business improvements, es pecially during the early stages.

To address this gap,  research questions ( Table 1 ) were created, and an MLR and case  survey were conducted. These approaches allowed the researchers  to assess extant studies on RE in software startups to address this  study’s research questions, as discussed below.  5.1.1. Answer to RQ1 (requirement sources)  The ﬁrst research question aimed to discover what sources are  used by software startups to collect requirements for products or  services. From the MLR, it was found that elicitation processes are  important in terms of stakeholder collaborations, and they often  depend on the types of targets (either customers or users) star tups set for products (see [P18], [P8], and [P26]). The results of  the case survey revealed that internal sources are the most used  sources for gathering requirements (they were used in 89% of the  cases). Apart from this, potential and existing customers (used in  74% of the cases) and analyses of similar products (used in 70% of  the cases) are other frequently used sources of requirements.  Internal sources are often employed because, during the ini tial stages of development, customers and users of products are  unknown; hence, startups’ best choice is collecting requirements  from internal sources by inventing or brainstorming. Furthermore,  concerning sources identiﬁed and selected during decision pro cesses, most sources emerge via in-house decisions or using staff during internal decisions or when building on past experiences in  members’ experiences with similar product domains. Therefore,  similar product development domains, startups favor internal re sources, potential and existing customers, and analyses of similar  products.  5.1.2. Answer to RQ2 (elicitation methods)  One objective of the study (in the second research question)  was identifying elicitation methods startups use to collect require ments from selected sources. The data in Table 8 show that analyz ing similar products (done in 68.8% of the cases), conducting ded icated brainstorming session (done in 65% of the cases), and con ducting customer interviews (done in 60% of the cases) are signiﬁ cant elicitation methods used to extract requirements. These meth ods are employed in different ways. For example, analyses of sim ilar products are used to search for information about how certain  features of rival products are developed, while dedicated brain storming sessions are used to experiment with different products  and elicit innovative ideas from participants. In addition, customer  interviews are used to conﬁrm which features meet customers’ ex pectations. In some cases, the above elicitation methods were ap plied systematically, whereas in others, ad hoc approaches were  employed to determine the requirements.  5.1.3. Answer to RQ3 (requirements documentation)  The third question was, “How are requirements documented in  software startups?” The case survey results ( Table 10 ) showed that  many startups (37% of the cases) had internal documents in the  form of informal notes, that is, tickets formed in ticket tracking and  other tools, such as Google Drive. Another widely used technique  (22% of the cases) for documentation is drawing on whiteboards  and posters. Whiteboards are used to draw high-level user stories,  write, and manage features. For example, some studies ([P18] and  [P10]) stated that startups do not have clear documentation pro cesses and use various tools, such as physical and electronic boards  with sticky notes, to document requirements and make product re quirements visible to all staff members. It should be noted that  this study also found that many startups document requirements  at the feature and function levels (33 and 15 of the cases did so,  respectively).",,09/05/2019 23:21:50,

From the case survey,  The fourth research question was about requirement prioritiza in terms of the criteria used to decide which requirements should  be implemented in the future, it was found in most of the star tups (84% of the cases) that values to customers, products, com panies, and shareholders were given the highest priority regard ing feature implementation ( Table 11 ). Moreover, to manage re quirements, most startups used incremental work processes. Some  studies ([P8] and [P6]) stated that requirements are prioritized and  managed using scenarios (effort and priority estimates) and plan ning games.  5.1.5. Answer to RQ5 (requirements validation)  By analyzing the empirical data ( Table 12 ), it was found that in The ﬁnal research question was about requirement validation.  ternal reviews of prototypes are employed by most startups (58%  of the cases) to validate product requirements. Such reviews are  used before products are launched to customers to ensure there  are no unknown risks or costs before implementing the products.  Demonstrations to customers (used in 49% of the cases) and cus tomer interviews (used in 43% of the cases) are the secondand  third-most common methods used for validation. Product demon strations conﬁrm customers’ and users’ opinions and increase the  product segments. Customer interviews validate products’ func tionality and collect customer feedback. In fact, in some articles  ([P18] and [P33]), it was noted that requirement validation is an  important process in terms of reducing uncertainties and unknown  problems, improving interactions with users and customers, and  building support [P27].  5.2.

Paternoster et al. (2014) mentioned that RE in software startups,  especially in terms of eliciting the description and managing the  requirements, is challenging. They also pointed out that customers  and users are unknown, and requirements are often market driven.  Furthermore, requirement speciﬁcation is challenging, and require ments often change rapidly.

694,2018-Tripathi et al,###,"5.4. Validity discussion  To discuss the validity of our study, we use validity criteria,  including the external, conclusion, internal, and construct validity  to evaluate the research, as described in Zhou et al. (2016) and  Runeson and Höst (2009) .  5.4.1. External validity  External validity involves how much results of a study are ap plicable to other contexts. The data used to address this study’s re search questions came from an MLR and case survey that focused  on RE in software startups. To enhance the generalization scope,  the MLR incorporated all relevant extant literature using keywords  (based on our earlier study and other researchers’ study on the  topic) that reﬂected RE in software startups. One threat to the ex ternal validity can be the literature’s restricted time interval; this  was overcome by not using a time ﬁlter in our search, and thus,  the literature retrieved was from 20 0 0–2016. Another threat can  be related to insuﬃcient research evidence in the primary articles.  This threat is valid in our study, since several primary articles (sci entiﬁc and gray literature) had a limited focus on the studied topic.  Moreover, most startups in the case survey belonged to various  domains, but they largely from South America and Europe; thus,  there is a limitation in terms of generalization of the results and  their applicability in a software startup context.  5.4.2. Conclusion validity  followed to come to credible conclusions and if the same results  Conclusion validity involves whether a proper procedure was  would be obtained if the procedure were repeated. Concerning the  literature review, a systematic process was used to identify scien tiﬁc and gray articles that reﬂected the requirements in software  startups. One threat could be related to bias in the study selection.  This threat was overcome by two authors jointly working on the  study search and selection procedure. Furthermore, to make the  process concrete, tools were used to perform the literature review,  with a process that has been proven to be effective in various stud ies. Another threat to conclusion validity could be the improper  classiﬁcation of the primary articles. This threat was reduced by  using the guidelines in Wieringa et al. (2006) to evaluate the arti related to the primary study replication; this was overcome with  cles in terms of research classiﬁcation. One more threat could be  the use of instruments like StArt and Microsoft Excel tools to auto mate the process so that duplicate articles would be disregarded.  Similarly, concerning the case survey, a design based on experi garding RE were based on the co-authors’ previous study. In ad ences shared by startup practitioners was used, and questions re dition, a software startup research community reviewed the ques tions, and the survey was pilot tested by a few startups before it  was made available to the public.

To address this, the participants (researchers and  terested in the case survey results for use in their research or star tups. To meet their interest, the results of the case survey were  made available to them for further use.  5.4.3. Internal validity  Internal validity involves determining whether there is a causal  relationship between the two factors and whether the third fac tor has any inﬂuence on the investigated one. Concerning the  MLR, one threat could be an incorrect search method. To over come this threat, the recognized scientiﬁc databases were used in  the search method and for accessing the gray literature Google’s  search engine was employed. Similarly, during execution of the  keyword search strings, the two researchers worked simultane ously. The two authors checked each other’s results during the",,09/05/2019 23:21:50,

696,2018-Tripathi et al,###,"search method. Another threat could be culture bias. However,  this threat was overcome because the two authors who executed  the MLR were from the same country. Another threat could be  related to publication bias, and this was overcome in our study  by focusing on ﬁnding both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed  (unpublished) literature on the subject. Similarly, the case survey  used guidelines proposed in other studies. In its early development  stage, the case survey was cross-checked by multiple researchers  in a workshop. Therefore, it is possible for the other researchers  to conduct MLRs and case surveys on topics similar to this study’s  topic.  5.4.4. Construct validity  Construct validity involves ﬁnding the suitable operational mea sures for the concepts under study, as well as determining whether  operational measures represent the viewpoint of the researcher  and the research aligns with the research questions. For the MLR,  to address the RQs, articles with related keywords regarding RE  and software startups were selected. One threat related to con struct validity could be the imprecise description of the MLR set ting. To overcome this threat, a review protocol was followed, us ing the guidelines from the existing literature, to search for the sci entiﬁc and gray literature separately. In addition, tools assisted in  the clear description of the MLR settings. Another threat could be  the use of incorrect keywords. To address this, the keywords were  adopted from the earlier studies on the phenomena to ﬁnd suitable  literature to answer the RQs. Similarly, for the case survey, the sur vey questions were designed in such a way that they could address  the RQs. Furthermore, the questions were pilot tested with some  software startups, and therefore, other respondents found them to  be appropriate before they were launched oﬃcially.  6. Conclusion and future work  Software startups are innovative in nature and have the poten tial to create products that scale rapidly in the market. Since soft ware startups are new and inexperienced organizations, the use of  standardized practices during software development are inconsis tent (as reported in the previous literature). In the software devel opment process, RE has a key role to play for the success of the  startup context to help these companies to create requirements  project. Therefore, it is important to understand RE in the software  for developing successful products.
