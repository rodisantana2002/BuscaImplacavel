In a software engineering process domain, the usage of specification languages improve the quality and delivery time of the artefacts generated during the execution of the process activities. Cloud applications, or cloud services, are service-oriented applications whose consumption is constantly growing; however, their development require support for new roles and activities. In this work we are interested in knowing how specification languages are being used by researchers and practitioners to support the development of cloud services. This work presents a systematic mapping that provides guidance to determine the current state and to characterize the specification languages that support the service life cycle activities in a cloud services development domain.","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030- 05532-5_6"

Utility driven platforms on the cloud makes the services easy to use and access by customers. There are several utility platforms available and many more are being developed. This makes utility driven platforms on the cloud an interesting area to research on. However, deciding on a specific research area that relates to utility driven platforms on the cloud could be a cumbersome process for a researcher. A systematic mapping study allows an aggregation of publication in an area of interest, which provides a summary of the extent of work done in that field. The specific objective is to conduct a systematic mapping study of utility driven platforms for clouds. The study in this paper were carried out using three categories or facets; the topic, research, and contribution facets. The results obtained indicated that there were more publications in terms of scheduling and algorithms in the area of metric with 0.96{\%}, more articles published on designs and architecture in terms of tool with 4.81{\%} each, more papers published on design in the area of model with 18.27{\%}, more paper on scheduling in the area of method with 6.73{\%}, and more papers on allocations in terms of process with 6.73{\%}. In addition, there were more articles published on design in the area of evaluation research with 9.24{\%}, more articles published on algorithms in terms of validation research with 6.72{\%}, more publications on design in terms of solution research with 11.76{\%}, more articles published on design in relation to philosophical papers with 2.52{\%}, more articles published on design in terms of experience with 3.36{\%} and more publications on scheduling in terms of opinion with 1.68{\%}. In this study, the clearly identified gaps in the field of utility driven platforms on the cloud should invigorate enthusiasm for further studies by researchers and industry professionals. This investigation plainly recognized holes in the field of utility driven stages on the cloud, which ought to invigorate enthusiasm for further examinations by scientists and industry professionals.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-030-30577-2_68"

We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies that investigated the current level of adoption of cloud computing in the education systems and motivations for using cloud computing in the institution. Seven papers were included in our synthesis of evidence. It has been found that several universities are interested in using cloud computing in their education systems, and they have utilized different types of cloud computing service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). The results of this SLR show that a clear gap exists in this research field: a lack of empirical studies focusing on utilizing cloud computing within educational institutions.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-319-21410-8_55"

It is aiming to find out the current trends around microservices, the motivation behind microservices research, emerging standards and the possible research gaps.

Despite the increasing acceptance of cloud computing within the industry, many important questions remain unanswered. Issues related to the best software architectures decisions for cloud-based systems are faced with the question of appropriate techniques applying at early phase like requirements engineering. The goal of this paper defines a design of a mapping study to verify and identify the existence of relevant research gaps, which refers mainly to requirements models, tools or methods for cloud systems (SaaS). The conclusion of this mapping study design reinforces and actively encourages the necessity of the complete execution (and replication) of a systematic mapping study regarding the synergy of requirements engineering (e.g.: with model-driven issues) applied for a cloud computing.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-319-62407-5_24"

Cloud Computing expands the SOA capabilities by adding scalability, elasticity and other relevant quality attributes. In this context, many companies have started to migrate their SOA applications to Cloud environments without proper support. We conducted a systematic mapping study to gather the current knowledge about existing strategies for migrating SOA applications to cloud computing. 105 papers were identified and the results show that most of the approaches follow a semi-automated (conventional) strategy for migrating to the Cloud (93{\%}) and that most of the reported works follow a hybrid deployment model (60{\%}). We additionally identify several research gaps such as the need for more technology-independent solutions, a common definition for concepts and resources, tool support, and validation.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-319-67283-0_1"

Due to the increasing use of these services, the quality of service (QoS) of cloud computing has become an important and essential issue since there are many open challenges which need to be addressed related to trust in cloud services. Many research issues have been proposed in QoS approaches in the cloud computing area. Objective: The aim of this study is to survey current research on QoS approaches in cloud computing in order to identify where more emphasis should be placed in both current and future research directions. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to find the related literature, and 67 articles were selected as primary studies that are classified in relation to the focus, research type and contribution type. Result: The majority of the articles are of the validation research type (64{\%}). Infrastructure as a service (48{\%}) was the largest research focus area, followed by software as a service (36{\%}). The majority of contributions concerned methods (48{\%}), followed by models (32{\%}). Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that QoS approaches in cloud computing have become an important topic in the cloud computing area in recent years and there remain open challenges and gaps which require future research exploration. In particular, tools, metrics and evaluation research are needed in order to provide useful and trustworthy cloud computing services that deliver appropriate QoS.","","Cloud services, Systematic mapping study,Quality of service","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2014.12.015"

Different Cloud Service Evaluation Methods (CSEMs) have been developed to address the problem. Cloud services are evaluated against multiple criteria, which leads to a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. Yet, studies that assess, analyse, and summarize the unresolved problems and shortcomings of current CSEM-based MCDM are limited. In the existing review studies, only individual parts of CSEMs, rarely the full solution, are reviewed and examined. To investigate CSEMs comprehensively, we present a systematic literature review based on Evaluation Theory, a theory that generalizes six evaluation components, target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques, synthesis techniques, and evaluation process. These six evaluation components and the CSEMs validation approach are the seven dimensions used to assess and analyse 77 papers published from 2006 to 2016. Sixteen research deficiencies were identified. The results confirm that the majority of the studies of the proposed CSEMs were either incomplete or lacked sufficient evidence. This research not only provides the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different CSEMs but also offers a basis for researchers and decision makers to develop improved CSEMs.","","Cloud service evaluation method, Evaluation theory, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), Systematic literature review,Cloud computing service","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2018.01.038"

Despite the recent advances that have made IoT a reality, there are several challenges to be addressed towards exploiting its full potential and promoting tangible benefits to society, environment, economy, and individual citizens. Recently, Cloud Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to tackle some of the existing challenges in IoT while leveraging its adoption and bringing new opportunities. With the combination of IoT and Cloud Computing, the cloud becomes an intermediate layer between smart objects and applications that make use of data and resources provided by these objects. On the one hand, IoT can benefit from the almost unlimited resources of Cloud Computing to implement management and composition of services related to smart objects and their provided data. On the other hand, the cloud can benefit from IoT by broadening its operation scope to deal with real-world objects. In spite of this synergy, the literature still lacks of a broad, comprehensive overview on what has been investigated on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing and what are the open issues to be addressed in future research and development. The goal of this work is to fill this gap by systematically collecting and analyzing studies available in the literature aiming to: (i) obtain a comprehensive understanding on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing paradigms; (ii) provide an overview of the current state of research on this topic; and (iii) identify important gaps in the existing approaches as well as promising research directions. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was performed covering papers recently published in journals, conferences, and workshops, available at five relevant electronic databases. As a result, 35 studies were selected presenting strategies and solutions on how to integrate IoT and Cloud Computing as well as scenarios, research challenges, and opportunities in this context. Besides confirming the increasing interest on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing, this paper reports the main outcomes of the performed systematic mapping by both presenting an overview of the state of the art on the investigated topic and shedding light on important challenges and potential directions to future research.","","Cloud Computing, IoT, Systematic mapping,Internet of Things","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2016.03.012"

It is important to systematically analyze and synthesize the existing research on architecting cloud-based software systems in order to build a cohesive body of knowledge of the reported challenges and solutions. We have systematically identified and reviewed 133 papers that report architecture-related challenges and solutions for cloud-based software systems. This paper reports the methodological details, findings, and implications of a systematic review that has enabled us to identify 44 unique categories of challenges and associated solutions for architecting cloud-based software systems. We assert that the identified challenges and solutions classified into the categories form a body of knowledge that can be leveraged for designing or evaluating software architectures for cloud-based systems. Our key conclusions are that a large number of primary studies focus on middleware services aimed at achieving scalability, performance, response time, and efficient resource optimization. Architecting cloud-based systems presents unique challenges as the systems to be designed range from pervasive embedded systems and enterprise applications to smart devices with Internet of Things. We also conclude that there is a huge potential of research on architecting cloud-based systems in areas related to green computing, energy efficient systems, mobile cloud computing, and Internet of Things.

Our goal is to gain insights into the current status of Cloud and SORE research published to date. To this end, we conducted a systematic mapping study to develop a map to classify relevant literature published between 2007 and 2018. Out of the 326 studies that were examined, we selected 24 studies as primary studies. The resulting map provides an overview of the existing work on Cloud and SORE and makes it possible to identify gaps and plan and position future research. Our findings suggest that Cloud and SORE as a research context needs specific attention. More evaluation and validation research is needed to better understand the implementation and impact of the various solutions (e.g. frameworks, tools) that are proposed in the Cloud and SORE context.","","","","","10.1142/S0219649220400109"

It has changed the dynamics of IT consumption by means of a model that provides on-demand services over the Internet. Unlike the traditional hosting service, cloud computing services are paid for per usage and may expand or shrink based on demand. Such services are, in general, fully managed by cloud providers that require users nothing but a personal computer and an Internet access. In recent years, this model has attracted the attention of researchers, investors and practitioners, many of whom have proposed a number of applications, structures and fundamentals of cloud computing, resulting in various definitions, requirements and models. Despite the interest and advances in the field, issues such as security and privacy, service layer agreement, resource sharing, and billing have opened up new questions about the real gains of the model. Although cloud computing is based on a 50-year-old business model, evidence from this study indicates that cloud computing still needs to expand and overcome present limitations that prevent the full use of its potential. In this study, we critically review the state of the art in cloud computing with the aim of identifying advances, gaps and new challenges.","","","","","10.1007/s11227-014-1089-x"

However, due to their size and complexity, large companies tend to focus on the structure in maintaining their business, which can potentially lower their agility to innovate. Objective The aims of this study are to provide an overview of the current research on innovation initiatives and to identify the challenges of implementing those initiatives in the context of large software companies. Method The investigation was primarily performed using a systematic mapping approach of published literature on corporate innovation and entrepreneurship, which was then complemented with interviews with four experts with rich industry experience. Results Our mapping study results suggest that, there is a lack of high quality empirical studies on innovation initiative in the context of large software companies. A total of 7 studies are conducted in the context of large software companies, which reported 5 types of initiatives: intrapreneurship, bootlegging, internal venture, spin-off and crowdsourcing. Our study offers three contributions. First, this paper represents the map of existing literature on innovation initiatives inside large companies. The second contribution of this paper is to provide an innovation initiative tree. The third contribution is to identify key challenges faced by each initiative in large software companies. Conclusions At the strategic and tactical levels, there is no difference between large software companies and other companies. At the operational level, large software companies are highly influenced by the advancement of Internet technology. In addition, large software companies use open innovation paradigm as part of their innovation initiatives. We envision our future work is to further empirically evaluate the innovation initiative tree in large software companies. More practitioners from different companies should be involved in the future studies.","","Corporate entrepreneurship, Corporate innovation, Innovation initiative, Large software companies, Systematic mapping study,Innovation","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2017.12.007"

There is a need to guide them kicking off a mapping study of an unfamiliar domain. This paper proposes a 5W+1H pattern to help investigators systematically examine a generic set of dimensions in a mapping study toward the formulation of research questions before identifying, reading, and analyzing sufficient articles of the topic. We have validated the feasibility of our proposal by conducting a case study of a mapping study on cloud software testing, that is, software testing for and on cloud computing platforms. The case study reveals that the 5W+1H pattern can lead investigators to define a set of systematic, generic, and complementary research questions, enabling them to kick off and expedite the mapping study process in a well-defined manner.

Over a decade of research on MDS has resulted in a large number of publications. Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR ) is essential. Method: We conducted an extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary MDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified, strictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of our SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified primary MDS studies. For example, regarding security modelling artefact, we found that developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches. The current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the identified primary MDS studies into 5 significant MDS studies, and other emerging or less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains supporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the application of MDS methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this SLR is the first in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy with database searching.

Since that the security protection the threats to outsourced data have become a very challenging and potentially formidable task in cloud computing, many researchers have focused on ameliorating this problem and enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security using remote data auditing (RDA) techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the remote data storage auditing in single cloud server domain and presents taxonomy of RDA approaches. The objective of this paper is to highlight issues and challenges to current RDA protocols in the cloud and the mobile cloud computing. We discuss the thematic taxonomy of RDA based on significant parameters such as security requirements, security metrics, security level, auditing mode, and update mode. The state-of-the-art RDA approaches that have not received much coverage in the literature are also critically analyzed and classified into three groups of provable data possession, proof of retrievability, and proof of ownership to present a taxonomy. It also investigates similarities and differences in such framework and discusses open research issues as the future directions in RDA research.","","Proof of ownership, Proof of retrievability, Provable data possession, Remote data auditing,Cloud computing","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2014.04.011"

The twelve principles are inferred from agile values. Agile principles are composition of evolutionary requirement, simple design, continuous delivery, self-organizing team and face-to-face communication. Due to changing market demand, agile methodology faces problems such as scalability, more effort and cost required in setting up hardware and software infrastructure, availability of skilled resource and ability to build application from multiple locations. Twelve (12) principles may be practiced more appropriately with the support of cloud computing. This merger of agile and cloud computing may provide infrastructure optimization and automation benefits to agile practitioners. Objective: This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) identifies the techniques employed in cloud computing environment that are useful for agile development. In addition, SLR discusses the significance of cloud and its challenges. Method: By applying the SLR procedure, the authors select thirty-seven (37) studies out of six-hundred-forty-seven (647) from 2010 to 2017. Result: The result of SLR shows that the techniques using existing tools were reported in 35{\%}, simulations in 20{\%} and application developed in 15{\%} of the studies. Evaluation of techniques was reported in 32{\%} of the studies. The impact of cloud computing was measured by the classification of four major categories such as transparency 32{\%}, collaboration 50{\%}, development infrastructure 29{\%} and cloud quality attributes in 39{\%}. Furthermore, a large number of tools were reported in primary studies. The challenges posed by cloud adoption in agile was reported as interoperability 13{\%}, security {\&} privacy 18{\%} and rest of the primary studies did not report any other research gaps. Conclusions: The study concludes that agile development in cloud computing environment is an important area in software engineering. There are many open challenges and gaps. In particular, more quality tools, evaluation research and empirical studies are required in this area.","","Agile methodology, Agile software development, Cloud computing, Systematic review,Agile","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2018.06.014"
