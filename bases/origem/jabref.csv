On one side, administrative law provides public bodies with all the needed powers and prerogatives to face and overcome different types of market failures. On the other side, administrative law is a typical regulatory device aiming to face some structural and functional distortions of bureaucracy, as a multi-principal agent. From this economic (and political) point of view, administrative law is much less stable than what it is usually thought to be. Frequent changes in both substantive and procedural rules can be explained as the outcome of repeated interactions among the legislator, the bureaucrats and the private stakeholders.","","","","","10.1007/978-1-4614-7883-6_526-1"

Here I first review some of the scholarship on the premodern period, especially the formation of European nation states and conflicts. It is fairly clear that Europeans emerged out of this period with a comparative advantage in violence, through technological innovations and repeated warfare. Fiscal innovation and expansion was a key part of this. The period of the revolutions and Napoleonic conflicts represented a change in the nature of warfare and the arrival of total war, as well as the industrial age. The period of the world wars represents perhaps the best represented area of study for economic historians as of late. New data and scholarship has shown the mechanics of mobilization and highlighted the importance of resources in deciding these conflicts. Conversely, the Cold War period has been relatively sparsely studied, at least from the perspective of conflicts or military spending. Given the availability of new data and the opening of many archives, it is highly likely that this state of affairs will change in the near future. Economic historians have clearly made an impact in the study of long-run phenomena such as state formation, empires, and democracy. Cliometrics is well suited to the study of such topics, given the new panel and time series techniques, the rapid development of computing power, and the many new online databases.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-642-40458-0_4-1"

There are three main goals for the application of smart home technologies. The first goal is to improve the level of comfort and ease of use of dwellings. The second goal is to improve the sense of safety and security inside and around a building. The third main goal is to use energy more efficiently. Despite the good intentions, the use of smart technologies at home does not automatically lead to achieving the three goals mentioned above. In addition, there are a number of requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to maximize the acceptance of such technologies by consumers. To date, the market of smart home technologies has, despite the growing number of companies and organization involved in this domain, not reached its stage of adulthood. Since the 1990s, many scenarios were laid out in which smart home technologies were portrayed as a promise for the future. Despite these positive scenarios, smart home technologies are still not daily business for many building services companies, advisers, and installers. Only when we can reach more uniformity in the domain of smart homes, we can expect a general growth of the market of smart homes. With the aging of society, there is an increasing need for more comfort and safety. But at present, there are simply too many standards, as well as producer-bound systems, which cannot, or hardly can, be combined or require the use of complicated and costly gateways. At this moment this is the most important obstacle.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-319-01904-8_23-1"

The chicory root with its high content of inulin-type fructans is the most common basis for gaining inulin from the plant. The process applied is a hot water extraction. This means, contrary to a number of commercially available dietary fibers, inulin is not synthesized but occurs naturally and was eaten by mankind 100,000 years ago. The colon, the main place of action of inulin-type fructans, is a highly active metabolic organ, containing an excessively complex collection of microbes. Inulin-type fructans are nondigestible in the small intestine and fermented in the large intestine, resulting in modifications in the colonic microbiota composition, towards a healthier pattern, and in the production of several metabolites. Thereby, they are among the very few scientifically proven prebiotics. Several health effects are related to this activity in the colon. They may range from local effects, starting with improvement of bowel movement, effects related to local immunity, to more systemic benefits for the body, as a result of the metabolic events, like weight and blood sugar management and bone health. This book chapter aims at providing a comprehensive review of the physiology related to inulin-type fructans and the health benefits related to this. Current developments in understanding the role of the microbiota in health and disease will probably also further contribute to understanding these complex influences originating from the gut and the role “colonic nutrients” such as prebiotic dietary fibers may play therein.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-319-03751-6_37-1"

Although many earlier qualitative works have indicated the factors that should be addressed to enhance such adaptive capacity, however very scanty of them quantitatively assessed the influences of those factors on various dimensions of people’s adaptive capacity. This chapter assesses quantitatively the influences of various demographic and socioeconomic, past adaptive behavioral, climate/weather information/knowledge products, and physical environmental (spatial/locational) factors on the adaptive capacity of coastal people against the livelihood insecurity that are caused by hydrometeorological events.The empirical part of this research was conducted in three villages of Kalapara Upazila (subdistrict) located close to the shoreline of Bay of Bengal in southwest part of Bangladesh. A total of 285 respondents were randomly interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire in 2009. Respondents were asked to rate their adaptive capacity against 25 impacts that cause their livelihood insecure. The principal component analysis (PCA) technique was employed to identify the major dimensions of livelihood insecurity. Livelihood insecurities are related to (a) severe constraints in agriculture farming and allied activities; (b) severe damage of physical and socioeconomic infrastructures; (c) severe constraints in fishing (mostly offshore) related activities; and (d) severe crisis in freshwater supply and public health risk. How does adaptive capacity against each of these four dimensions of livelihood insecurity differ due to the influence of various factors is assessed by employing multiple analysis of variance (ANOVAs) technique.The ANOVAs show that among the demographic and socioeconomic factors, sex, education, occupation, farmland holding, membership status (of social institution), and social capitals have the strongest influence on differential adaptive capacity in general. Similarly, among the past adaptive behavioral factors, except the freshwater crisis all other variables, namely, adaptation against flood, rainfall, and salinity intrusion have strong influence in making difference in adaptive capacity. Likewise, almost all climate/weather information/knowledge products have statistically significant influence on various dimensions of adaptive capacity. The policy implication is that while launching any program to enhance the adaptive capacity of coastal people against the threats of hydrometeorological disastrous events on their livelihood security, the identified factors need to be accounted.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-642-40455-9_39-1"

The rational and sensible management and development of all activity spheres, including transportation and logistics, is connected with this concept. The transition to the fourth industrial revolution, the concepts of digitalization and the Internet of Things cannot be implemented without sustainable logistics. Development of technology in the era of Sustainable Development Goals implementation and rational resources consumption led to the formulation and new concept of economic development—the circular economy. This concept changes the paradigm of logistic processes organization, where reverse logistics, along with direct supply chains, becomes one of the elements of logistic chains. To ensure the efficiency of transport and related technological operations during the goods movement, new technologies are used at all stages of transportation. To achieve these goals, transport infrastructure is being created and improved, and one of the most important elements of this infrastructure are the transport terminals. The paper discusses the modern concepts of intermodal transport and the role of transport terminals in their implementation. The issues of terminal activity planning and process management, as well as determining the required capacity of terminal complexes are considered. Mathematical and simulation models for selecting parameters of intermodal transport systems have been developed, an example of organizing the supply of spare parts in the KAMAZ branded service system has been given (Case Study: Organization of the Automotive Spare Parts Supply).","","","","","10.1007/978-3-030-11512-8_10"

This has inevitably stimulated efforts to create a wide-area infrastructure that goes beyond simple store-and-forward to create a platform that makes more general and varied use of the potential of this collection of increasingly powerful nodes. Historically, these efforts predate the advent of globally routed packet networking. The desire for a converged infrastructure of this kind has only intensified over the last 30 years, as memory, storage, and processing resources have increased in both density and speed while simultaneously decreasing in cost. Although there is a general consensus that it should be possible to define and deploy such a dramatically more capable wide-area platform, a great deal of investment in research prototypes has yet to produce a credible candidate architecture. Drawing on technical analysis, historical examples, and case studies, we present an argument for the hypothesis that in order to realize a distributed system with the kind of convergent generality and deployment scalability that might qualify as “future-defining,” we must build it from a small set of simple, generic, and limited abstractions of the low level resources (processing, storage and network) of its intermediate nodes.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-030-12385-7_48"

Equality is designed based on chordal ring networks. It advances previous discussed chordal ring topologies by a set of systematic linking strategies and routing rules. The Equality topology can be used construct low diameter networks with reasonably low router radices. Equality interconnects are highly symmetric and hence cabling rule and routing logic are simple. Compared with other networks, the Equality topology is flexible in total number of routers, where any even number is allowed. This paper introduces the evaluation of Equality performance using open-source BookSim 2.0 package. The benchmarks of ten traffic models for systems constructed using 36- and 48-port switch are presented to assess the network performance, compared with the very popular 2-tier fat-tree structure.

Projects, implemented as part of the concept, should be combined with strategic effectiveness, durability of development capital, as well as the contribution of allocation efficiency. Implementation of activities in accordance with the sustainable development concept gives the regions the basis for the effective implementation of such development.","","","","","10.1007/978-3-030-11274-5_2"

To test a conceptual model that explores these complementary phenomena, structural equation modeling analyses are performed with data gleaned from luxury cruise passengers. Analysis results found that brand tribalism positively affects the formation of perceived power among luxury cruise passengers. In addition, luxury cruise passengers’ engagement in activities that co-create value is largely dependent on their power perception. This study contributes to the theoretical development of luxury consumer behavior research, and managerial implications are also discussed based on the findings.","","","","","10.1007/s11628-018-0373-x"

While some researchers have found grounds for optimism in the diminution of state control over people’s bodies, others see the change as merely a more sophisticated version of state control which has become, if anything, more invasive of individual lifestyle choices. In this paper I show how the institutionalization of hierarchical power relations does justify optimism about ways of confronting the complex mechanisms of control entailed in modern biopower. I claim that the crux of control in our information society derives from the transposition of the pastoral power described by Michel Foucault to the modern state and that the institutionalization of hierarchical power relations can constitute an effective countermeasure to that power. Hierarchical power exchanges can generate a social and cultural framework which, while operating according to the logic of biopower, expands modes of thought and practice beyond the unified thinking that contributes significantly to the modern state’s control over the individual.","","","","","10.1007/s12119-018-9563-x"

In this study, the proposed fuzzy best–worst method is employed as a multi-criteria decision-making method to map Strategy Canvas of a manufacturing company in Iran. The proposed method is concerned with the proposition of a new approach to eliciting the weight vector from the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices.

The same holds true for welfare state research which assigns a vital role to the middle class, especially when redistributive measures have to be stabilised and legitimised. However, in these debates, it is largely overlooked that the middle class is an ambiguous concept which can bear a variety of meanings and argumentative functions. Against this background, this paper does not want to investigate what the middle class is, but rather how it gains meaning in discursive practices in different societies. Empirically, we compare German and Swedish media debates in regard to how meaning is attributed to the middle-class category as well as regarding the latter’s role in the legitimisation and problematisation of the welfare state. The analysis reveals that while in the German discourse the middle class’ well-being is considered to be the major aim of the welfare state and for the benefit of the whole society, the Swedish discourse is split into two threads: one which criticises the middle class for furthering social gaps and a second one which accuses the universal welfare state for constraining the autonomy of middle-class members. We argue that these differences between (and within) both discourses are due to different interpretive schemes which are anchored in the respective sociocultural context. The analysis thus demonstrates the additional value of an interpretive perspective which helps understanding the specific ways in which the welfare state becomes the object of political debate in different societies.","","","","","10.1007/s10767-018-9275-0"

It has been more than 20 years since the APT was enacted as a building block for restoration of the Everglades ecosystem, the most extensive environmental restoration project in the world. This article provides a historical perspective on the environmental, socio-political, and institutional factors that led to the enactment and evolution of the APT. The efficiency and equity of the tax as part of a broader program to achieve water quality goals for the Everglades are also evaluated. A key result of this evaluation is that the APT has encouraged reductions in nutrient loads from agricultural areas, but these contributions have been limited. Dramatic increases in abatement costs to treat nonpoint outflows with stormwater treatment areas have occurred, and the timeline to achieve water quality objectives has been pushed forward by decades beyond the original goal. Contrary to the polluter pays principle, political compromises that have shaped the APT since its inception have shifted an increasing share of the burden to the public to reduce the flow of nutrients into the Everglades. An inconsistent regulatory approach to reduce nonpoint sources throughout the Everglades watershed may be the most important impediment to Everglades restoration.","","","","","10.1007/s13412-018-0529-y"

So far, no clear legal and economic theory has yet been delineated by the European Commission, nor consensus in the literature has emerged with regard to the theory of foreclosure that could support the case, or with regard to the specific form of abuse of dominance applicable under European law. The paper shows that the law and economics of tying applies to search bias. From a legal standpoint, it is not necessary to rely on the more formalistic elements of Article 102 TFEU, or to characterize Google as an essential facility, in order to find a valid legal theory of harm. We show that Google’s conduct of linking its proprietary vertical (or specialized) search platforms to its horizontal (or general) search platform through visual prominence, as it has done with Google Shopping, fits within the legal boundaries of tying under European law. From an economic perspective, we show that the two-sided nature of both horizontal and vertical search provides compelling reasons why foreclosure of competition may be profitable, and why the single monopoly profit theorem may fail in this context. As we show in the paper, by tying vertical search to general search through visual prominence, Google can attract additional advertisers on its vertical search platform that would have possibly advertised on competing vertical search platforms without a tie. The effect of tying is a restriction on competition in vertical search that deserves antitrust scrutiny.","","","","","10.1007/s10657-018-9602-y"

In this context, we argue that a more elaborate understanding is needed of how partners intend to reach beyond the partnership boundaries and target stakeholders at the firm, industry, supply-chain, or societal levels. As environmental improvement is intertwined with the process of change, we build on the theory of planned change to explain how the focus on selected partnership mechanisms may help partners anticipate and overcome barriers when targeting environmental improvement at these different levels. We test our framework, using a sample of 566 environmental partnerships formed in the USA, and provide rich insights into how partners intend to reach beyond the partnership boundaries. From a practical perspective, these insights may inform corporate managers’ decision to configure environmental partnerships in terms of the target group and suitable partnership mechanism. From a theory perspective, the study helps develop a more systematic understanding of what partners intend to do and when (i.e. on the basis of which mechanism) partnerships may provide benefits in addressing level-specific change barriers.

High-skilled migrants who are employed in academia, IT or engineering increasingly incorporate the mobility demands of their ‘mobilised professions’. This paper examines how mobile professionals relate to their current place of residence, what kind of frictions they face and what forms of (alternative) belonging they develop in response. In doing so, the paper links ideas from governmentality studies with recent work from migration studies and the spatial sciences. Our analysis draws on interviews with high-skilled migrants in Manchester (UK). While broadly accepting the mobility demands of their respective fields of work without questioning, their resulting mobile practices often undermine the development of a sense of belonging based on place attachment and local social interaction. Our empirical material suggests that this potential conflict is mediated through the constitution of a group of ‘internationals’ who share mobile biographies and the experience of in-betweenness. Based on our findings, we suggest three directions for future research: to focus on the relational aspects of place ties, to investigate the role of the workplace and more specifically the employer, and to explore how places shape differential politics of belonging.","","","","","10.1007/s12134-018-0608-7"

The technologies considered were yield monitors, remote and proximal crop sensing, high resolution soil survey, soil moisture sensing and digital elevation models (DEM). Whereas Australian grain growers have readily adopted machine guidance and autosteer, and a majority have access to yield monitoring, the rate of use of many crop and soil sensors remains comparatively low. However, the survey results suggest a positive effect on sensor adoption through present use of yield mapping. Access to yield maps was significantly associated with the use of remotely sensed imagery, high resolution soil survey, soil moisture sensing, DEM and variable rate application of fertilizers and/or soil amendments. There is some support for proximal crop sensing, albeit with low present rates of use; the use of soil water sensors and DEM is presently very low. For the further development of precision agriculture (PA), the results make clear that expending effort in enhancing the adoption and use of yield maps would be valuable as a lever to gain ‘buy-in’ from growers to sensing and PA more broadly. Since growers use many sources of information to support fertilizer decision-making, any new fertilizer decision aid needs to establish a point of difference from, but be complementary to, existing tools. One way of achieving this would be to use sensors, supported by locally derived algorithms, as a key input to fertilizer decision support.","","","","","10.1007/s11119-018-9589-y"

Findings contribute to the understanding of current practice issues in dementia care while shifting the focus away from exclusively biomedical understanding.

The maintenance of heterostyly has often been ascribed to disassortative mating, but alternative explanations are also possible, which can be examined by analyzing mating patterns. However, parental analysis with genetic markers has only been applied to a limited number of taxa, despite the phylogenetic diversity of heterostylous species. Here, we examined the mating patterns of a distylous primrose, Primula kisoana (Primulaceae), in its natural habitat, using 11 microsatellite markers. We also examined other fitness components. We found no differences in seed production, vegetative growth, or survival between morphs. However, the siring success of thrum fathers was much higher than that of pin fathers; outcrossing occurred unilaterally between thrum fathers and pin mothers, and selfing was more frequent in thrum plants than in pin plants. These findings are consistent with the explanation that distyly in this species is maintained either by overdominance due to previously reported recessive lethal effects of the thrum allele or by effectively dioecious mating if inbreeding depression is strong. We built a mathematical model of the overdominance hypothesis to confirm that it is logically sound.

Ground motions for three hazardous fault sources for Aigion were generated using a finite source stochastic simulation technique, taking into account the well-established seismotectonics of the area and site effects derived from ambient noise horizontal-to-vertical-spectral-ratios (HVSR). Validation of the parameters of the stochastic simulation and the estimated damage was performed with respect to real recordings and the damage database of a past seismic event in the area. Vulnerability was assessed empirically for an exposure model comprising 3200 buildings, compiled with on site and remoted techniques. The European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98) was used to describe the ground motion severity in terms of macroseismic intensity and the taxonomy of the building stock into 7 structural types. Seismic risk was spatialized using GIS mapping tools on a building block scale in terms of EMS-98 damage grades and their maximum probability of occurrence. The obtained risk assessment models indicate that the northeastern and partly the southern part of Aigion are more susceptible to damage, in accordance with damage distribution from the most recent Mw6.4 disastrous earthquake for the city in 1995, the site amplification inferred from HVSR, and the assessed vulnerability of the constructions. Nevertheless, the current building stock demonstrates significantly enhanced seismic behaviour, due to rehabilitation after the 1995 earthquake.

However, the recent proliferation of competing and overlapping global sustainability standards that have been developed by various stakeholders with different agendas, creates uncertainties for firms that likely reduce their propensity to adopt any standard. Without widespread adoption these standards cannot effectively govern firm conduct and in contrast create barriers for firms’ access to export markets. We suggest that the uncertainties associated with competing standards and the effect of these uncertainties on standard certification decisions are especially large for firms in emerging economies because these firms lack access to information about current and future standards and the resources to obtain certifications to multiple standards. We theoretically propose and empirically identify three distinct sources of sustainability standard uncertainty: (i) diversity of customer requirements, (ii) dynamism of customer requirements, and (iii) the unpredictability of the future evolution of standard and propose that each of these sources reduces firms’ propensity to obtain certification to any standard. Our empirical results based on certifications to food safety standards by a sample of 97 Mexican food exporting firms confirm that three distinct sources of sustainability standard uncertainty exist and that all of them negatively impact certification. We discuss ethical implications and offer recommendations for both suppliers as well as standard setting organizations.","","","","","10.1007/s10551-016-3350-0"

In so doing, the paper responds to calls for empirical insight into how accounting can inform organisational objectives relating to sustainability. Despite known flaws in the data, the company’s weekly sustainability reports had become a critical support to on-going sense-making, driven by deliberate strategies focused on resource efficiency, and understanding the business. While the contributions of these initiatives to broader global sustainability concerns were limited, the case provides insight into a well-intentioned and passionate journey towards the unknown of sustainability. The case explains how management distinguished related activities from core economic objectives. What is important here is that the CEO availed space for management to explore the moral dimensions of corporate activity. There was opportunity to now enhance that space, by encouraging engagement with a broader range of stakeholders, and a broader range of sustainability impacts.","","","","","10.1007/s10551-017-3445-2"

Country-specific evidence was synthesized from the demographic and health survey and published studies. The model simulated the sexual and reproductive health experience of women in the reproductive age range over a time horizon of women’s reproductive years, from the healthcare payer perspective. Modeled outcomes included clinical events, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) expressed as cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty on modeled outcomes.ResultsIn the hypothetical cohort of 100,000 women, scenarios to reduce the unmet need for family planning would result in savings within a range of US$230,600–US$895,100 and US$564,400–US$1,865,900 in Indonesia and Uganda, respectively. The interventions would avert an estimated 1859–3780 and 3705–12,230 DALYs in Indonesia and Uganda, respectively. The results of our analysis indicate that scaling up family planning dominates the current situation in all scenarios in both countries, with lower costs and fewer DALYs. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses.ConclusionScaling up family planning interventions could improve women’s health outcomes substantially and be cost-effective or even cost saving across a range of scenarios compared to the current situation.","","","","","10.1007/s40258-018-0430-6"

In this work, the state estimation method during landing maneuver is explored for the first of its kind, using upper diagonal adaptive extended Kalman filter (UD-AEKF) with fuzzy based adaptive tunning of process noise matrix. The mathematical model for symmetrical landing maneuver consists of non-linear flight mechanics equation representing Aircraft longitudinal dynamics. The UD-AEKF algorithm is implemented in MATLAB environment and the states with bias is considered to be the initial conditions just prior to the flare. The measurement data is obtained from a non-linear 6 DOF pilot in loop simulation using FORTRAN. These simulated measurement data is additively mixed with process and measurement noises, which are used as an input for UD-AEKF. Then, the governing states that dictate the landing loads at the instant of touch down are compared. The method is verified using flight data wherein, the vertical acceleration at the aircraft center of gravity (CG) is compared. Two possible outcome of purely relying on the aircraft measured data is highlighted. It is observed that, with the implementation of adaptive fuzzy logic based extended Kalman filter tuned to adapt for aircraft landing dynamics, the methodology improves the data quality of the states that are sourced from noisy measurements.","","","","","10.1007/s40032-017-0428-0"

Each Internet service aims to promote information exchange among people who share common interests, activities, or goods. Internet service providers aim to have users of their services actively communicate through their services. Without active interaction, the service falls into disuse. In this study, we consider that an Internet service has a network externality as its main feature, and we model user behavior in the Internet service with network externality (ISNE) as a dynamic game. In particular, we model the diffusion process of users of an ISNE as an infinite-horizon extensive-form game of complete information in which: (1) each user can choose whether or not to use the ISNE in her/his turn and (2) the network effect of the ISNE depends on the history of each player’s actions. We then apply Markov perfect equilibrium to analyze how to increase the number of active users. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition under which the state in which every player is an active user is the unique Markov perfect equilibrium outcome.

Using structural equation modeling to analyze data collected from 190 firms in China, the study documents that interactional justice positively affects both TMB and TMP, while procedural justice positively affects TMB (but not TMP) in the IeSCII implementation process. In contrast, distributive justice is not significantly related to either TMB or TMP, but is positively associated with information sharing.

New management regimes could revolutionize agricultural production, but require an evaluation of the risks and opportunities. Replacing existing conventional weed management with genetically modified, herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops, for example, might reduce herbicide applications and increase crop yields, but remains controversial owing to concerns about potential impacts on biodiversity. Until now, such new regimes have been assessed at the species or assemblage level, whereas higher-level ecological network effects remain largely unconsidered. Here, we conduct a large-scale network analysis of invertebrate communities across 502 UK farm sites to GMHT management in different crop types. We find that network-level properties were overwhelmingly shaped by crop type, whereas network structure and robustness were apparently unaltered by GMHT management. This suggests that taxon-specific effects reported previously did not escalate into higher-level systemic structural change in the wider agricultural ecosystem. Our study highlights current limitations of autecological assessments of effect in agriculture in which species interactions and potential compensatory effects are overlooked. We advocate adopting the more holistic system-level evaluations that we explore here, which complement existing assessments for meeting our future agricultural needs.Large-scale network analysis of invertebrate communities across >500 arable farms in the United Kingdom reveals that genetic modification for herbicide tolerance has little influence on overall network structure, which is largely shaped by crop type.","","","","","10.1038/s41559-018-0757-2"

It charts the evolution of global health policy and governance in the post-World War II international order to the current post-2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals era. In order to respond adequately existing and emerging health and development challenges across developing regions, the paper argues that global health governance and related structures and institutions must adapt to changing socio-economic circumstances at all levels of decision-making. Against the background of a changing world order characterised by the decline of US-led Western international liberalism and the rise of the emerging nations in the developing world, it identifies the ‘Rising Powers’ (RPs) among the emerging economies and their soft power diplomacy and international development cooperation strategy as important tools for responding to post-2015 global health challenges. Based on analysis of illustrative examples from the ‘BRICS’, a group of large emerging economies—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—the paper develops suggestions and recommendations for the RPs with respect to: (1) stimulating innovation in global health governance and (2) strengthening health systems and health security at country and regional levels. Observing that current deliberations on global health focus largely, but rather narrowly, on what resource inputs are needed to achieve the SDG health targets, this paper goes further and highlights the importance of the ‘how’ in terms of a leadership and driving role for the RPs: How can the RPs champion global governance reform and innovation aimed at producing strong, resilient and equitable global systems? How can the RPs use soft power diplomacy to enhance disease surveillance and detection capacities and to promote improved regional and international coordination in response to health threats? How can they provide incentives for investment in R&D and manufacturing of medicines to tackle neglected and poverty-related diseases in developing countries?","","","","","10.1007/s40647-018-00250-2"

The rapid development of various big data tools such as Hadoop, Storm, Spark, Flink, Kafka and Pig in research and industrial communities has allowed the huge number of data to be distributed, communicated and processed. Big data applications use big data analytics techniques to efficiently analyze large amounts of data. However, choosing the suitable big data tools based on batch and stream data processing and analytics techniques for development a big data system are difficult due to the challenges in processing and applying big data. Practitioners and researchers who are developing big data systems have inadequate information about the current technology and requirement concerning the big data platform. Hence, the strengths and weaknesses of big data technologies and effective solutions for Big Data challenges are needed to be discussed. Hence, due to that, this paper presents a review of the literature that analyzes the use of big data tools and big data analytics techniques in areas like health and medical care, social networking and internet, government and public sector, natural resource management, economic and business sector. The goals of this paper are to (1) understand the trend of big data-related research and current frames of big data technologies; (2) identify trends in the use or research of big data tools based on batch and stream processing and big data analytics techniques; (3) assist and provide new researchers and practitioners to place new research activity in this domain appropriately.

Danish minority governments gained little by involving unions, because they were no longer reliant on an extra-parliamentary channel of consensus mobilisation. Flexible majority-building in the parliamentary arena allowed them to seek their preferred policy output independent from union consent. The onset of the Great Recession therefore allowed governments of the right as well as the left to dismiss the one single actor that mobilised political support for workers at risk of unemployment.

One finding is that China has moved away from the period of “hiding one’s strength and biding one’s time” and is now acting in a more norm-making and agenda-setting role in which it is seeking largely incremental change. Another finding is that China is doing these things through a variety of global governance forms such as inter-governmental organizations with a fairly highly degree of formality, looser international organizations that have weaker implementation capacity and unilateral initiatives which put China very much in a leadership position. Findings are based on an examination of major activities of the Xi period, including hosting the G20 leaders’ summit in Hangzhou, China, joint creation of new multilateral development banks, and the Belt and Road Initiative. The paper also touches on motives for China’s activities, including hedging against adverse developments in the international system, greater wealth, and a global power vacuum that has arisen with the rise of nativist and populist movements in the West, and possible constraints to the realization of China’s objectives such as slowing domestic economic growth and a backlash against China’s globalization, which could intensify.","","","","","10.1007/s11366-019-09610-5"

After reviewing the commonly used design methods and their resulting monitoring setups, it was evident that multivariate statistical analysis is the most frequently used method for designing WQM networks in rivers. The majority of studies reported in the literature were conducted on very large rivers and originated from high- to middle-income countries. Most commonly monitored water quality parameters cover the general physicochemical characteristics and organic pollutants, without considering the ecological quality of the river. In most studies, decision on sampling frequencies depended on expert’s judgements. Data availability and expertise seem to affect the selection of design methods rather than river size and the extent of the monitoring networks. Findings from this study support that future research should simultaneously consider all relevant aspects at watershed scale and focus more on biological indicators.

We review RTB seed systems—with particular reference to potato, sweetpotato, cassava, yam and banana —to reflect on current seed system development approaches and the unique nature of these systems. We refer to our own experiences, literature and 13 case studies of RTB seed system interventions to identify gaps in our knowledge on farmer practices in sourcing and multiplying seed, and processes affecting seed quality. Currently, most approaches to developing RTB seed systems favour decentralised multiplication models to make quality seed available to smallholder farmers. Nevertheless, arguments and experiences show that in many situations, the economic sustainability of these models cannot be guaranteed, among others because the effective demand of farmers for seed from vegetatively propagated crops is unclear. Despite the understudied nature of farmers’ agronomic and social practices in relation to seed production and sourcing in RTB crops, there is sufficient evidence to show that local RTB seed systems are adaptive and dynamic. Our analysis suggests the paramount importance of understanding farmers’ effective demand for seed and how this affects the sustainable supply of quality seed from specialized producer-entrepreneurs, regardless of the seed system paradigm. From the case studies we learnt that few interventions are designed with a rigorous understanding of these issues; in particular, what types of interventions work for which actors, where, and why, although this is a necessary condition for prioritizing investments to increase the use of improved seed by smallholder farmers.","","","","","10.1007/s12571-018-0874-4"

The analysis finds that age, family structure, education, income and occupation are important determinants for Bangladeshi people to decide between labor and money donations as well as their respective amount. The poor and less educated households with high natural resource dependence are identified to significantly contribute to overall donations via labor. The rich and more educated people with low natural resource dependence are willing to donate money and little labor, but the magnitude of donations is small. Labor and money donations exhibit the relation of substitutability with respect to most socioeconomic variables. Education and income do not positively affect overall donations in Bangladesh. This finding is in sharp contrast with the studies in USA or Europe, and illustrates that labor donation is an important channel to natural disaster mitigation that should be utilized for public betterment in developing countries.","","","","","10.1007/s10018-018-0221-1"

This paper draws together Foucauldian and Bourdieusian literatures on this topic to investigate how “embodied neoliberalism” (internalized individualism and self-responsibility) intersects with performances of “embodied cultural capital” (high-status markers used to create social distinction). Through an ethnographic case study of upper-middle class white “Fun Runners” in Boulder, Colorado, I ask how people with culturally valued thin, fit bodies enact social status and produce exclusion in an interactional setting. My findings challenge a straightforward translation of “hard work” into status, as we might expect based on neoliberal discourse. Instead, I argue that runners engage in two simultaneous (seemingly paradoxical) forms of boundary work: First, they perform hard work, discipline, and deservingness – drawing boundaries against those who do not engage in the work of bodily discipline; Second, they perform ease and fun – drawing boundaries against those who lack the habitus to make this work appear easy and natural. I contend that the resulting performance of the “ease of hard work” makes the status of thin, fit bodies appear both earned and natural, a doubly effective means of producing exclusion and legitimizing status. These findings reveal that embodied neoliberalism intersects with race and class-based habitus, while also shedding light on how people in privileged positions claim to “deserve” their status through narratives of color-blind meritocracy despite evidence of structural inequalities.","","","","","10.1007/s11133-019-9412-8"

These relationships are hierarchical and rigid at early stages, but over time evolve into more collaborative partnerships. Eventually, social enterprises embrace impact measurement as a tool for organizational learning, and social finance organizations develop more empowering approaches for impact measurement. The level of flexibility and the closeness of the relationship between social finance organizations and social enterprises suggest important lessons for the development of a more enabling use of impact measurement.","","","","","10.1007/s11266-018-00081-5"

For this purpose, we employ cluster analysis which can identify groups of traffic flows that show similarity using only the application level information. In our work, we applied three unsupervised clustering algorithms, namely MinMax K-Means, OPTICS and AutoClass, to classify video traces obtained from an emulated environment. The experimental results show that the employed algorithms are able to effectively distinguish video flows generated by different play-out strategies.

At the northern periphery of the Boumba-Bek National Park in Southeast Cameroon, little is known about which habitat type contain the highest abundance of NTFP species. In this study, we assessed habitat diversity and variation in the abundance of eight priority NTFP species comprising: Afrostyrax lepidophyllus, Baillonella toxisperma, Irvingia gabonensis, Panda oleosa, Pentaclethra macrophylla, Ricinodendron heudelotii, Scorodophloeus zenkeri and Tetrapleura tetraptera. The inventory was done along 16 linear transects of 5000 m × 20 m, and all the individuals, from juveniles (DBH < 5 cm) to mature trees (DBH > 5 cm) of the eight NTFPs were recorded. Habitat types were characterized along transects following basic forest classification system used in ecology and then measured.ResultsIn total, 13 different habitat types were identified with young secondary forests and periodically flooded forests representing 32.70% and 26.31% respectively. The least represented habitat was young fallows with Chromolaena odorata (0.08%). Seven NTFPs (A. lepidophyllus, B. toxisperma, I. gabonensis, P. oleosa, P. macrophylla, R. heudelotii and T. tetraptera) were predominantly represented in young secondary forests whereas S. zenkeri was more abundant in young Marantaceae secondary forests. The different types of young secondary forests identified seem to be favourable for the growth of the eight NTFPs.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that habitat fragmentation driven by human activities such as industrial logging and shifting cultivation destroy the forest ecosystems and has a strong influence on the sustainability of the major NTFPs in the locality.","","","","","10.1186/s12898-019-0219-y"

To study the automation process, we consider the hierarchical ABAC model as our reference model since it better reflects the requirements of real-world organizations. Therefore, this paper focuses on the questions of: how can we automatically infer the hierarchical structure of an ABAC model given NLACPs; and, how can we extract and define the set of authorization attributes based on the resulting structure. To address these questions, we propose an approach built upon recent advancements in natural language processing and machine learning techniques. For such a solution, the lack of appropriate data often poses a bottleneck. Therefore, we decouple the primary contributions of this work into: (1) developing a practical framework to extract authorization attributes of hierarchical ABAC system from natural language artifacts, and (2) generating a set of realistic synthetic natural language access control policies (NLACPs) to evaluate the proposed framework. Our experimental results are promising as we achieved - in average - an F1-score of 0.96 when extracting attributes values of subjects, and 0.91 when extracting the values of objects’ attributes from natural language access control policies.","","","","","10.1186/s42400-018-0019-2"

There is, however, a lack of research on the process of managing and coordinating strategic capital investment projects where investment proposals and decisions are seen as human constructions. The controller is an important but seldom noticed actor in this process. This paper draws on a pragmatic constructivist framework to create an understanding of the controller role in strategic capital investment projects and how the controller acts to contribute to create a functioning construct causality in such projects. We conducted a case study of a mining company, which had recently decided on strategic capital investments resulting in the moving of two towns to enable continued operations. Based on a two-step thematic data analysis, our results illustrate that the controller is an essential actor in strategic capital investment projects with high degrees of uncertainty and multiple decision-participants. By using the pragmatic constructivist framework we find that gap-bridging between multiple decision-participants is an essential role for controller, in order to create successful investment proposals. The case study further illustrates that controllers need to learn to speak technical and operational language and to become knowledgeable about business operations to gain trust in order create a functioning construct causality. Our study provides an actor-focused understanding of the organizational and managerial processes within strategic capital investment projects, illustrating how the controller contributes to construct causality therein.","","","","","10.1007/s10997-018-09449-7"

As the core of regional economic growth, central cities play a leadership role that drives other cities to develop agricultural products within this region. The reserve of Internet talents and the scale of the express logistics industry are essential bases for the growth of agricultural product e-commerce in urban areas. However, there is no spillover effect on this domain; online agricultural products are enormously dependent on the processing industries. Agricultural products have highly similar shapes and highly overlapping targets in markets in different cities within the same region. The demands of agricultural product e-commerce are compressed, and its development is hindered because the processing industries that have developed in central cities face fierce competition from surrounding cities. Central cities have great appeal to talents within the region, which affects the development of e-commerce in other cities by withdrawing the human resources of surrounding cities.","","","","","10.1007/s10257-019-00408-9"

Context strongly influences implementation; not all initiatives will be successful and experimentation is vital. Successful initiatives included HiAP influencing the urban planning department to be more concerned with the health impacts of planning decisions, and encouraging the environment department to be concerned with the health impacts of its work.ConclusionsThe theory-based program logic suggests that SA HiAP facilitated improved population health through working with multiple government departments. Public servants came to appreciate how their sectors impact on health. Program logic is a mechanism to evaluate complex public health interventions in a way that takes account of political and economic contexts. SA HiAP was mainly successful in avoiding lifestyle drift in strategy. The initiative encouraged a range of state government departments to tackle conditions of daily living. The broader underpinning factors dictating the distribution of power, money and resources were not addressed by HiAP.

These issues of spatial dynamics question urban policies, because they underline the lack of interest in freight in the planning process. Indeed, one of the major issues in planning logistics facilities is the lack of a good understanding of the logistics sector: it is difficult to guide public action in the absence of detailed and precise data. The great heterogeneity of logistics facilities is often underestimated by public policies. The visibility of some sectors in public policies or academic literature, as parcel industry or e-commerce, hides other sides of logistics as an industry sector. With this paper we underline differences in the location of facilities, which translates into a difficult implementation of public policies to regulate logistics sprawl in the case of the Paris region. This paper studies precisely the location of the warehouses and terminals, and their place in the spatial organization of logistics facilities in the Paris Region.

A first level of culture involves practices specific to a delimited sphere of action. In the British approach, a salaried worker is assimilated to an external supplier who delivers products and remains within a relationship tied to the provision of services without engaging his or her person. By contrast, in the German approach, the salaried worked is viewed as fully engaging his or her person in the company, while also being associated with the company’s overall functioning.

To investigate the set of molecules within native growth cones that form specific connections, here we developed growth cone sorting and subcellular RNA–proteome mapping, an approach that identifies and quantifies local transcriptomes and proteomes from labelled growth cones of single projections in vivo. Using this approach on the developing callosal projection of the mouse cerebral cortex, we mapped molecular enrichments in trans-hemispheric growth cones relative to their parent cell bodies, producing paired subcellular proteomes and transcriptomes from single neuron subtypes directly from the brain. These data provide generalizable proof-of-principle for this approach, and reveal molecular specializations of the growth cone, including accumulations of the growth-regulating kinase mTOR2, together with mRNAs that contain mTOR-dependent motifs3,4. These findings illuminate the relationships between subcellular distributions of RNA and protein in developing projection neurons, and provide a systems-level approach for the discovery of subtype- and stage-specific molecular substrates of circuit wiring, miswiring, and the potential for regeneration.A subcellular sorting approach enables quantitative analysis of subtypes of growth cones in the brain, and reveals subcellular relationships between local mRNA and local proteomes in developing projection neurons.","","","","","10.1038/s41586-018-0847-y"

This first iteration of the Bottom/Base of the Pyramid approach (known as BoP 1.0) focused on selling to the poor. In 2008, after ethical criticisms leveled at it, the field moved to BoP 2.0, instead emphasizing business co-venturing. Since 2015, we have witnessed some calls for a new iteration (BoP 3.0), with the focus broadening to a more sustainable development approach to poverty alleviation. In this paper, we seek to answer the question: How has the BoP approach evolved over the past 16 years, and has it delivered on its early promise? We conducted a systematic review of 276 papers published in journals in this period, utilizing a rigorous correspondence analysis method to map key trends, and then further examined the 22 empirical studies conducted on the BoP approach. Our results suggest that the field has evolved, passing through a number of trends and coming full circle—with our analysis pointing to more recent BoP literature emphasizing similar themes to those espoused in the initial BoP iteration (i.e., treating the BoP as consumers), rather than reflecting the principles espoused in either BoP 2.0 or BoP 3.0. Our analysis also points to a lack of clear evidence that the BoP concept has delivered on its promise either to businesses (that they can serve BoP markets profitably) or to BoP participants (that involvement by multinational corporations will help alleviate poverty).","","","","","10.1007/s10551-019-04105-y"

Principal components of the pathway that activate Notch target genes are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom.

Repressors are known from arthropods and vertebrates that differ strikingly by mode of action: whereas Drosophila Hairless assembles repressor complexes with CSL transcription factors, competition between activator and repressors occurs in vertebrates (for example SHARP/MINT and KyoT2). This divergence raises questions on the evolution: Are there common ancestors throughout the animal kingdom?ResultsAvailable genome databases representing all animal clades were searched for homologues of Hairless, SHARP and KyoT2. The most distant species with convincing Hairless orthologs belong to Myriapoda, indicating its emergence after the Mandibulata-Chelicarata radiation about 500 million years ago. SHARP shares motifs with SPEN and SPENITO proteins, present throughout the animal kingdom. The CSL interacting domain of SHARP, however, is specific to vertebrates separated by roughly 600 million years of evolution. KyoT2 bears a C-terminal CSL interaction domain (CID), present only in placental mammals but highly diverged already in marsupials, suggesting introduction roughly 100 million years ago. Based on the LIM-domains that characterize KyoT2, homologues can be found in Drosophila melanogaster (Limpet) and Hydra vulgaris (Prickle 3 like). These lack the CID of KyoT2, however, contain a PET and additional LIM domains. Conservation of intron/exon boundaries underscores the phylogenetic relationship between KyoT2, Limpet and Prickle. Most strikingly, Limpet and Prickle proteins carry a tetra-peptide motif resembling that of several CSL interactors. Overall, KyoT2 may have evolved from prickle and Limpet to a Notch repressor in mammals.ConclusionsNotch repressors appear to be specific to either chordates or arthropods. Orthologues of experimentally validated repressors were not found outside the phylogenetic group they have been originally identified. However, the data provide a hypothesis on the evolution of mammalian KyoT2 from Prickle like ancestors. The finding of a potential CSL interacting domain in Prickle homologues points to a novel, very ancestral CSL interactor present in the entire animal kingdom.","","","","","10.1186/s41065-019-0081-0"

The analysis focuses on solidarity as reciprocity and, in particular, how it is affected by such factors as actor motivations, internal participatory functioning, resource mix and political legitimacy. While further empirical work is needed, the findings suggest that solidarity as reciprocity produced by social and solidarity economy organisations thrives where political institutions are both supportive and trusted, where public funding is accessible, and where partnerships with relatively autonomous social and solidarity economy organisations are genuinely collaborative.","","","","","10.1007/s11266-018-0031-x"

We then sought to understand the underlying mechanism of collaboration that might explain the different (non)leadership phenomena. Our study’s main result is the empirically grounded identification of two distinct forms of network participation with specific network identities as its core, which are related to the distinct leadership-related phenomena in our networks. (1) Task-based network identity, which includes an individualistic network identity, a single achievement motivation, and a largely instrumentalist orientation towards network participation, is related to a leadership void (non-leadership emergence, i.e. a form of leaderless cooperation). (2) Joint-motivational network identity, which includes a collectivistic network identity, joint network motivation, and a largely value-laden attitude towards network participation, is related to shared leadership. Our findings shed new light on collaboration and leadership phenomena in interorganizational networks, concurrently providing progress on conceptualizing shared leadership, in particular by introducing joint-motivational network identity as a new concept related to shared leadership development.

Establishing normative conformance is problematic given the plurality of norms and values worldwide, and is particularly difficult for companies operating in morally controversial industries. In this paper, we investigate how organizations publicly legitimize the trade of human tissue for private profit when this practice runs counter to deep-seated and widespread moral beliefs. To do so, we use inductive, qualitative methods to analyze the website discourse of three types of organizations that trade in human tissue and are associated with different degrees of moral controversy with respect to tissue procurement and use. Our analysis reveals an object-oriented approach to moral legitimizing centered on the human tissue as a morally disputed good. We find that the website discourse translates human tissue into technology, constructs normative meaning around a dominant instrumental value associated with human-tissue-as-technology, and reproduces and stabilizes this meaning by six discursive mechanisms that amplify and anchor it. Moreover, the use of amplifying and anchoring discourse was greater in organizations associated with greater controversy.

First, there are risks to consumer welfare associated with AI pricing software’s capacity to solve uncertainty (for example, supra-competitive equilibria may not be disrupted by changes in demand). Second, the use of artificial neural networks can make detection of anticompetitive pricing patterns more difficult. On the other hand, if authorities can harness the power of the technology themselves, detection problems could be alleviated. Third, the black box argument may not be a problem in this application of artificial neural networks since the pricing software industry has been able to develop more transparent algorithms in response to market demands.

Violation of equity has the greatest impact on price unfairness  perceptions, followed by consumer's inability to understand procedures.

Führt eine für den Anbieter ineffiziente Nutzung seiner Leistungen durch die Nachfrager zu erhöhten Kosten, ist der Anbieter zur Erhöhung der Preise gezwungen. Eine geringere Marktnachfrage kann die Folge sein. Verhaltensabhängige Preise bieten mit ihrer Anreizwirkung die Möglichkeit, diesem Problem zu begegnen. Erste Praxisbeispiele zeigen aber, dass die Kunden verhaltensabhängige Preise nicht immer akzeptieren. Zu den Gründen hierfür existieren bislang kaum Erkenntnisse. In dem vorliegenden Beitrag wird daher ein Erklärungsmodell zur Kundenakzeptanz verhaltensabhängiger Preise entwickelt und empirisch überprüft. Es wird gezeigt, dass neben dem Abwägen von Preisersparnis einerseits und Nutzungsfreiheit andererseits insbesondere ein „Wohlfühlfaktor“ mit dem Preismodell von Bedeutung ist. Um konkrete Empfehlungen für die Angebotsgestaltung ableiten zu können, wird zudem das Zustandekommen von sowohl dem Abwägungsergebnis von Preisersparnis und Nutzungsfreiheit als auch von diesem Wohlfühlfaktor untersucht. Hierbei werden mehrere konkrete Effekte identifiziert, wie z. B. der Preisfairness- oder der Smart-Shopping-Effekt, welche diese Bewertungen und damit die Akzeptanz maßgeblich beeinflussen.AbstractIn many cases, operating costs depend on the customers’ usage behavior. Increased cost due to inefficient usage may result in increasing prices and therefore decreasing demand. Usage behavior-based pricing has the potential to mitigate this problem by providing an incentive to use products or services cost-efficiently. First practical implementations, however, show that customers do not necessarily accept usage behavior-based pricing. Currently there is little knowledge on customer acceptance of this price model. For that reason, we develop and empirically test an explanation model for customer acceptance of usage behavior-based pricing. We show that besides the weighing of savings on the one hand and loss of freedom on the other hand, there is a substantial influence of a “feel-good factor” with the price model. Additionally, we analyze the antecedents of the weighing of savings and loss of freedom as well as of the feel-good factor in order to derive concrete recommendations for the price stimulus design. With this, we identify several effects that significantly influence the evaluation of the price model, e. g. price fairness effect or smart shopping effect.","","","","","10.1007/s41471-018-00061-x"

A financial management information system based on improved genetic algorithm is proposed based on the financial management information system data mining and clustering analysis model framework, and based on the financial analysis related knowledge. By adopting the event-driven architecture, a financial management information system model based on data mining technology is constructed, which not only enables the data warehouse and data mining technology to play a role in decision support, but also enables the financial information and non-financial information of enterprises to be fully utilized. By extracting financial data, using the above decision tree classification algorithm for data mining, classifying tests according to subject categories and business processes, and evaluating the accuracy of the prediction results, and then determining whether the classification algorithm is selected. The test and analysis of the national tax financial analysis system were completed, and three public data sets and three national tax financial expenditure data sets were selected, and the algorithm was tested on the experimental platform. The test results show that the algorithm show good performance for large-scale data sets, especially financial expenditure data sets, and the test accuracy rate is not only stable but also maintains a relatively high range.","","","","","10.1007/s10257-018-00394-4"
