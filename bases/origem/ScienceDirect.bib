However the arguments to date have overlooked issues of testability, over-explanation, and normative power, and they are undermined by a definitional slide in the justification of service-dominant logic. We discuss these issues and suggest that they may create problems for service-dominant logic in its current form. We call for further conceptual development to address these points, and to enable discriminative tests between alternative service-based interventions."

(2018) used idealized model experiments to test the sensitivity of glaciation to changes in temperature, precipitation and shortwave radiation in the Western Cordillera, the Altiplano and the Cordillera Oriental (Eastern Cordillera) in the arid subtropical Andes. We point out that the application to Cordillera Oriental does not consider precipitation at the appropriate spatial scale, because precipitation gradients are steep in the area. Using high-resolution datasets we found that precipitation in the Cordillera Oriental is significantly lower than that considered as input in the model, and similar to the value used for the Western Cordillera. Considering more realistic precipitation data for the Cordillera Oriental would produce similar results to those from the Western Cordillera. Adequate parametric and scale inputs reinforce the importance of Vargo et al. (2018) modeling in order to predict glacial sensitivity to climate changes."

The paper applies and expands the multidisciplinary components of this new science in the transitional context of Poland. The authors suggest that this new science, in the context of Poland's transition, is best reflected in the innovative term ‘Curative International Marketing’. The authors conclude that still existing transitional gaps in Poland can be the result of neglecting the micro internal and meso B2B relationships. Macro factor development can be partially seen as a success story but also negatively affected B2B and internal relationships. The unconsidered concept of identity is regarded center stage to explain the relationship related phenomena. Based on the philosophy of Curative International Marketing, a future focus on B2B and internal relationships is regarded to be on the top of the agenda to improve value co-creation, and provide for a better health level of market systems as a whole."

Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to re-evaluate the value concept in services marketing. Specifically, an evaluation of how the term value has been defined and utilized within different marketing and consumption patterns from the goods dominant to service dominant logic eras is provided and an integrative value approach encompassing multiple levels of value creation process is proposed."

abstract = "Purpose
We aimed to assess patterns of relapse in patients undergoing salvage ASCT for relapsed HL in the modern-era with the hypothesis that patients suffering relapse at initially involved sites are at increased risks of relapse post-ASCT that may help guide the application of peri-transplant RT.
Materials/Methods
A retrospective review of 38 patients undergoing ASCT from 2002-2017 for relapsed or refractory HL. Site of relapse at time of ASCT and subsequent relapse were compared to sites of initial involvement at diagnosis using follow-up imaging most commonly PET/CT. Relapse and overall survival were calculated from the date of ASCT using the Kaplan Meier method with multivariate analysis completed using Cox multivariate analysis.
Results
The median follow-up was 38 months [Interquartile Range (IQR): 18-66 months]. Twenty-two patients (58%) suffered relapse following ASCT at a median time to relapse of 9.1 months (IQR: 2.9 -12.3) with a 5-year risk of relapse of 58% (95%CI: 41-75%). On univariate analysis, relapse at an initially involved site was significant for higher rates of relapse at 71% at 5-years (95% CI: 52-90%) compared to relapse at initially uninvolved sites 30% (95% CI: 2-58%), p=0.05. Relapse rate was also significantly higher in patients less than 30 years old at diagnosis at 80% (95% CI: 59-100%) compared to 40% (95% CI: 18-62%) at 5-years in patients greater than 30 years of age (p<0.01). On multivariate analysis, relapse at initially involved sites was significant for higher rates of relapse, HR 8.3 (95% CI: 1.2-57.4, p=0.03)
Conclusions
Relapse at initially involved sites may potentially increase risks of relapse after ASCT and additional studies are needed to clarify if this should be used as an additional factor to guide recommendations for peri-transplant RT."

Drawing on the stimulation hypothesis and the notion that communication with dissimilar others can encourage incivility, it was predicted that (1) heightened levels of negative campaign advertising would be associated with increased citizen activity on Twitter, (2) increased citizen activity would predict online incivility, and (3) that increases in citizen activity would facilitate a positive indirect relationship between negative advertising volume and citizen incivility. This theoretical model was tested using data collected from over 140,000 individual Twitter users located in 206 Designated Market Areas. The results supported the proposed model. Additional analyses further suggested that the relationship between negative political advertising and citizen incivility was conditioned by contextual levels of economic status. These results are discussed in the context of political advertising and democratic deliberation."

In moving forward within the new dominant logic as espoused by Vargo and Lusch, with its focus on operant resources, this research empirically examines the role of operant resource-based capabilities as antecedents to a firm's value offering. The findings show that firms seeking to create a superior value offering for customers should invest in and nurture operant resources-based capabilities. The heterogeneity of operant resource-based capabilities helps explain value offering differentials in which firms that emphasize strongly innovation-based capability as a dominant operant resource-based capability appear to create a superior value offering compared to those emphasizing marketing-based capability, while firms that focus strongly on production-based capability create little for the customer in value offering."

In our Contemporary Marketing Practices work we find that in the consumer products industry, especially, the traditional differentiation between what used to be a product and what used to be a service is becoming less relevant. However, our main argument is that since contemporary marketing practices are characterised by a pluralism of approaches, the Service Dominant (S-D) logic can be strengthened by recognising that firms need both to serve and create customers. In other words, given the exigencies that drive organisations to innovate, an additional foundational premise (FP) to the S-D logic is required to recognise the theoretical and practical differences between market-driven and market-driving approaches to innovation."

A market is one of the most founational abstractions in marketing and business research; yet, it often receives too little attention. As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets."

S-D logic can continue to advance over the next decade by moving toward further development of a general theory of the market and, even more broadly, to a general theory of value cocreation. To support this theory of the market requires developing more midrange theoretical frameworks and concepts of service exchange, resource integration, value cocreation, value determination, and institutions/ecosystems. These midrange theories can be partially informed by theories outside of marketing, including those under the rubrics of practice, evolutionary, complexity, ecological and structuration theories. Evidence-based research is also needed; opportunities exist in areas such as (1) strategy development and implementation (2) application of complexity economics and (3) the study of the service of cognitive mediators (assistants) as heuristic tools in complex service ecosystems. Additionally, opportunities exist for using S-D logic as a broader framework for the study of macromarketing, including ethics, economic, environmental and social sustainability, as well as public policy. For each of these, the further study of institutions and institutional arrangements, which facilitate coordination among actors in service ecosystems, is needed."
