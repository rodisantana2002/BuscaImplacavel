In this work, logistic models are developed to predict propylene compressor surge. Principal components analysis is used to select explanatory variables which exhibit high variance in the thirty minutes prior to a compressor surge event. Three types of models are developed: a main model based on principal components, a significant variables model and a model using interactions. Instances of each of the three model types were created using training data from three hazard events to create a total of nine predictive models. Each of the nine models was tested against data from a fourth hazard event. One of the nine models was capable of predicting surge events with a reasonable false alarm rate. The remainder of the models either did not identify any pre-hazard conditions or over-diagnosed by generating far too many false alarms. Future work will apply normalization and other techniques including the use of Process Plant Computing Limited's parallel coordinate plotting software.","","978-1-4577-0447-5978-1-4577-0446-8978-1-4577-0445","10.1109/SIEDS.2011.5876877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876877","","Surges;Predictive models;Data models;Computational modeling;Hazards;Principal component analysis;Logistics","failure analysis;hazards;logistics data processing;maintenance engineering;principal component analysis;process control;production engineering computing","principal component analysis variable selection;logistic model;plant hazard event prediction application;process control applications;catastrophic failure;propylene compressor surge;explanatory variables;parallel coordinate plotting software","","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This Terascale Computing System (TCS) will be built using commodity components. The computational engines will be Compaq Alpha CPU's in a four processors per node configuration. The final system will have over 682 quad processor nodes, for a total of more than 2700 Alpha CPUs. Each node will have 4 gigabytes of memory, for a total system memory of over 2.5 terabytes. All the nodes will be interconnected by a high speed, very low latency Quadrics switch fabric, constructed in a full ""fat-tree"" topology. Given the very high component count in this system, it is important to architect the solution to be tolerant of failures. Part of this architecture is the efficient saving of a program's memory state to disk. This checkpointing of the program memory should be easy for the programmer to invoke and sufficiently fast to allow for frequent checkpoints, yet it should not severely impact the performance of the compute nodes or file servers. There will be flexibility in the recovery so that spare nodes can be automatically swapped in for failed nodes and the job restarted from the most recent checkpoint without significant user or system management intervention. It is estimated that the file servers required to collect and store these checkpoints and other temporary storage for executing jobs will collectively have ?27 terabytes of disk storage. The file servers will maintain a disk cache that will be migrated to a Hierarchical Storage Manager serving over 300 terabytes. This paper will discuss the hardware and software architectural design of the TCS machine. The software architecture of this system rests upon Compaq's ""AlphaServer SC"" software, which includes administration, control, accounting, and scheduling software.

Taking advantage of plant operators' perceptual capabilities in the hazard identification process could enhance the aiding provided by other decision support systems. Parallel coordinate plotting allows the visualization of multidimensional data by making apparent geometric patterns that exist in the data sets. This work investigates the use of parallel coordinate plotting in anomalous process control applications. Approaches utilizing the software packages CVE and CPM as decision support tools are explored. These approaches with CVE and CPM are carried out in a case study on historical plant processing data. CVE is used to identify normal plant operating conditions and construct a “best operating zone” that can be loaded into CPM. CPM can then read in real-time or historical data and indicate (i.e, generate alarms) if the plant is leaving normal operating conditions and also recommend mitigation strategies to return the plant to normal operating conditions. CPM's alarms are evaluated as an effective method for determining the onset of a hazard event. Advantages and limitations of CVE and CPM as a decision support are identified through the case study. The results are discussed in the context of the static case study and the need for simulations is highlighted.","","978-1-4577-0447-5978-1-4577-0446-8978-1-4577-0445","10.1109/SIEDS.2011.5876862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876862","","Hazards;Decision support systems;Real time systems;Data visualization;Software packages;Process control","data visualisation;decision support systems;hazards;industrial plants;process control;production engineering computing;software packages","parallel coordinates plot;process control hazard identification;process plant;decision support system;multidimensional data visualization;software package;CVE;historical plant processing data;mitigation strategy;CPM alarm","","1","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the 19th century, the industrial revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as mass, energy, work, and power. During the 20th century, the information revolution was built on many powerful abstractions, such as binary digit or bit, binary coding, and algorithmic complexity. Here, we propose an abstraction that will be important to the service revolution of the 21st century: the service system, which is a configuration of people, technologies, and other resources that interact with other service systems to create mutual value. Many systems can be viewed as service systems, including families, cities, and companies, among many others. In this paper, we show how the service-system abstraction can be used to understand how value is created, in the process unifying concepts from many disciplines and creating the foundation for an integrated science of service.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3075","10.1109/HICSS.2008.451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438807","","Force measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Logic;Cities and towns;Power engineering and energy;Gravity;Technological innovation;Chemical processes;Chemical compounds;Electromagnetic forces","system theory","service system abstraction;industrial revolution;information revolution;algorithmic complexity;binary coding;binary digit;service science","","136","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such instances, the control problem is commonly simplified by first choosing a point estimate from the model prior, and then selecting the control policy that is optimal with respect to the point estimate. Our contribution is to demonstrate, through a tractable yet nontrivial example, that even the best control policies constructed in this manner can significantly underperform the Bayes optimal policy. While this is an operative assumption in the Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process literature, to our knowledge no such illustrative example has been formally proposed.","0018-9286;1558-2523;2334-3303","","10.1109/TAC.2014.2314527","National Science Foundation; Rolls-Royce Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781561","Adaptive control;Markov processes;stochastic optimal control;uncertain systems","Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Standards;Bayes methods","adaptive control;Bayes methods;decision theory;hidden Markov models;optimal control;stochastic systems","Bayesian control;partially observable Markov decision processes;hidden Markov model parameters;point estimate;optimal control policy;Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process;stochastic optimal control;adaptive control;optimal Bayes optimal policy","","3","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Toward this goal, we suggest that an emerging logic of value creation and exchange called service-dominant logic is a more robust framework for service science than the traditional goods-dominant logic. The primary tenets of service-dominant logic are: (1) the conceptualization of service as a process, rather than a unit of output; (2) a focus on dynamic resources, such as knowledge and skills, rather than static resources, such as natural resources; and (3) an understanding of value as a collaborative process between providers and customers, rather than what producers create and subsequently deliver to customers. These tenets are explored and a foundational lexicon for service science is suggested.","0018-8670","","10.1147/sj.471.0005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386536","","","","","","50","","","","","","IBM","IBM Journals & Magazines"
"Belief Propagation for Large-Variable-Domain Optimization on Factor Graphs: An Application to Decentralized Weather-Radar Coordination","E. P. Vargo; E. J. Bass; R. Cogill","Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA; Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA; Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","","2013","43","2","460","466","Due to the NP-hardness of factor-graph optimization, obtaining exact solutions to problems with a large variable domain is generally not possible. Max-sum (max-product) belief propagation (BP) is a distributed message-passing heuristic that has found popularity due to its ability to generate approximate solutions to such factor-graph problems in a distributed fashion. Because max-sum BP generally provides no indication of solution quality, researchers have sought alternative algorithms to generate approximate (and, in some cases, exact) solutions, the most successful of which operate on a relaxation of the integer programming form of an equivalent maximum a posteriori estimation problem. While such linear-programming-based algorithms perform well in empirical studies, there are limits to the variable domain size for which they are tractable. Via a case study in weather-radar coordination, we demonstrate that the decentralized max-sum BP algorithm remains useful for generating quality solutions to problems with a large variable domain. Our custom simulation tool facilitates a comparison of the performance of algorithms with respect to adaptive weather-radar scanning resource allocation across three weather scenarios. In addition to no adaptive scanning, the algorithms include four max-sum-BP-based algorithms: decentralized distributed max-sum BP, self-terminating tree-based bounded approximation, tabu search implemented in a centralized fashion, and a combination of the latter two. Performance is measured by the end-user utility for all algorithms and by two types of approximation ratios for the tree-based bounded approximation. BP-based decentralized algorithms are found to exhibit comparable performance with a centralized algorithm and superior performance to no adaptive scanning. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that max-sum BP is capable of generating solutions within 67% of optimal (and typically much better) across the weather scenarios.","2168-2216;2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2204740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301748","Combinatorial optimization;decentralized coordination;distributed max-sum (DMS);message passing;simulation","Meteorology;Optimization;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Meteorological radar;Spaceborne radar","approximation theory;computational complexity;graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;message passing;meteorological radar;radar computing;search problems;trees (mathematics);utility theory","large-variable-domain optimization;decentralized weather-radar coordination;NP-hardness;factor-graph optimization;large variable domain;Max-sum belief propagation;distributed message-passing heuristic;approximate solutions;factor-graph problems;integer programming;posteriori estimation problem;linear-programming-based algorithms;weather-radar coordination;weather-radar scanning resource allocation;adaptive scanning;max-sum-BP-based algorithms;decentralized distributed max-sum BP;self-terminating tree-based bounded approximation;tabu search;end-user utility;tree-based bounded approximation;BP-based decentralized algorithms;centralized algorithm","","3","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on a conceptual analysis of resource integration and value proposing as the foundational practices of value co-creation, this article portrays value propositions as the co-created forms of shared resources and understanding, which constitutes service systems. This view is inherently socially constructed and perceives value propositions as institutionalized, taken-for-granted social structures that influence local instances of resource integration within and between service systems. Because of the idiosyncratic local contexts for resource integration, however, value propositions do not completely govern resource integration. Instead, they are reproduced and transformed through the local interactions they influence. This mutually constituting nature between value propositions and resource integration affects our understanding of stability and change, creating novel avenues for studying innovation on the basis of service science.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-2504","10.1109/HICSS.2014.165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758762","Resource integration;Service-dominant logic;Service science;Value proposition","Context;Ecosystems;Biological system modeling;Technological innovation;Proposals;Lenses;Dynamic scheduling","service industries","resource integration;value propositions;value co-creation dynamics;service-dominant logic;service science;taken-for-granted social structures;idiosyncratic local contexts","","6","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Project management -- including project, program and portfolio management -- is examined, as an industry-agnostic discipline, through the S-D logic, service-ecosystems lens. Congruence between the S-D logic, service-ecosystems approach and emergent perspectives of project management -- including the motivation to see projects as complex, adaptable, dynamic, social processes undertaken to create value rather than products -- is highlighted. The research aim is to demonstrate that an S-D logic, service-ecosystems approach to project management offers a viable opportunity to strengthen the theoretical foundation of project management. This approach is positioned to consolidate current supportive, yet scattered research contributions and to, simultaneously, open new avenues to coalesce future interdisciplinary research contributions to strengthen and grow project management theory.","1530-1605","978-1-4799-7367","10.1109/HICSS.2015.166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069974","Project Management;service-dominant (S-D) logic;service ecosystems","Project management;Ecosystems;Portfolios;Organizations;Complexity theory;Production;Context","project management","service-ecosystems approach;project management;service-dominant logic;S-D logic;portfolio management;industry-agnostic discipline","","1","65","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, solving the Poisson equation is typically no easier than evaluating steady state behavior directly using the invariant probability mass function of the Markov chain. However, it is known that approximate solutions to the Poisson equation can be used to produce bounds on steady state performance and to accelerate simulations for estimating steady state behavior. In this paper we study the special structure taken on by the Poisson equation when the associated Markov chain is reversible. In particular, we show that reversible Markov chains have a special form of the Poisson equation that admits a closed form solution. As an application of the reversible Poisson equation we consider the construction of control variates that can be used in Markov chain-based samplers. We show one class of control variates that are obtained by approximating the known solution to the reversible Poisson equation, and demonstrate the application of these control variates on an example involving the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.","0191-2216;0743-1546;0743-1546","978-1-4673-2066-5978-1-4673-2065-8978-1-4673-2063-4978-1-4673-2064","10.1109/CDC.2012.6425978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425978","","Markov processes;Poisson equations;Mathematical model;Approximation methods;Steady-state;Equations;Accuracy","Markov processes;Poisson equation;probability","Poisson equation;reversible Markov chain;Markov chain samplers;steady-state behavior;finite-state Markov chain;optimality equation;average cost Markov decision process;invariant probability mass function;steady state performance;steady state behavior estimation;control variates;Metropolis-Hastings algorithm","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This concept illustrates the importance of the relationship between the service itself and its situation. This relationship is analogous to electro-magnetic field theory in physics. We developed the concept of using service fields in service systems to create service value based on an analogy of the electro-magnetic field. By using this concept, the ""value in use"" mechanism can theoretically be explained. By applying this concept to B to B collaboration, a model of service value co-creation can be formulated. An example of applying the proposed model to B to B collaboration is reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed concept of service fields.

"Market Resistance to Innovative Service-Focused Business Models: Insights from the Service-Dominant Logic","J. Freiling; S. M. Laudien; K.

Astonishingly, the pace of adoption of these new business models is rather low. By now, it is still open what the final reasons for this market resistance might be. We analyze this sluggish adoption by making reference to total cost of ownership (TCO) concepts as a prominent example of innovative, service focused business models. To this end, we mirror the diffusion and the obstacles to trade in the light of the concept of the service-dominant logic (SDL), developed by Vargo and Lusch [1]. So doing, we employ the competence-based theory of the firm (CbTF) as our theoretical foundation. We propose that the diffusion of innovative service business models like TCO depends on the stage of the transition process from a goods-dominant to a service-dominant logic in business and society. Thus, we raise our research question: To what extent is the sluggish adoption of TCO business models influenced by the state of the transition process from the goods-dominant to the service-dominant logic? Due to newness and complexity of our research topic we employ qualitative research and conduct case studies to better understand the reasons of sluggish TCO adoption.","1530-1605;1530-1605","978-1-4673-5933-7978-0-7695-4892","10.1109/HICSS.2013.393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6479863","business model innovation;total cost of ownership;service-dominant logic;competence-based theory of the firm","","electronic commerce;marketing data processing","market resistance;innovative service focused business models;service dominant logic;business-to-business model;B-to-B model;total cost of ownership;TCO;SDL","","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
